不，他才不呢
He doesn't.

42
00:04:06,846 --> 00:04:09,337
- 他是喜欢你 - 你喜欢他
- Does. - You fancy him.

43
00:04:09,482 --> 00:04:11,006
才不是呢
I don't think so.

44
00:04:14,254 --> 00:04:17,712
你知道我们三人要 一起乘车旅行三个星期
The three of us are going to Be stuck in a car together for three weeks,

45
00:04:17,790 --> 00:04:21,624
如果总是想“是说我吗？” “他今天是不是表现不自然？”
and it'll Be trying enough without "is it me, or is he Being weird today?"

46
00:04:21,694 --> 00:04:23,059
那会让我看起来像花痴
Lt'd drive me Barmy.

47
00:04:23,429 --> 00:04:25,659
是啊，你说得对
Yeah. You're right.

48
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:29,191
不过他倒是很招人喜欢
He is cute, though.

49
00:04:29,269 --> 00:04:32,033
你说他真的有个女朋友在悉尼吗？
Do you think he's really got a girlfriend in Sydney?

50
00:04:32,105 --> 00:04:33,470
他有必要说谎吗？
Why would he lie?

51
00:04:33,539 --> 00:04:34,767
他可是个小伙子
He's a Bloke.

52
00:04:41,881 --> 00:04:43,781
真不敢相信我们要出发了
I can't Believe we're leaving.

53
00:04:43,850 --> 00:04:45,340
是啊，我知道
I know.

54
00:04:46,352 --> 00:04:48,877
感觉像是两年 而不是两周
It feels like two years, not two weeks.

55
00:04:54,894 --> 00:04:55,883
嘿！
Whoo!

56
00:04:58,197 --> 00:04:59,186

00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,729
- 你们想搭车吗？ - 太好了
- Want a lift? - I'd love it.

58
00:05:02,802 --> 00:05:04,394
我记得我说过要一辆紫色的
I thought I requested purple.

59
00:05:04,537 --> 00:05:07,062
嘿！才1500元，还带着车门 就谢天谢地了
Eh. For 1,500 Bucks we're lucky it's got doors.

60
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:08,129
我喜欢
I love it.

61
00:05:08,207 --> 00:05:09,367
我的东西在哪？
Hey, where's my stuff?

62
00:05:09,442 --> 00:05:11,342
哦，我们忘了给你拿吃的 对不起啊
We forgot aBout food for you. Sorry.

63
00:05:11,411 --> 00:05:14,539
是啊我们以为你听到 我们的感谢就会浑身是劲
Yeah, we thought you'd get By on our gratitude and appreciation.

64
00:05:18,551 --> 00:05:20,280
哇，哇，哇，哇
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

65
00:05:22,288 --> 00:05:23,516
酒在哪？
Where's the Booze?

66
00:05:23,589 --> 00:05:25,250
哦，我们决定
Oh, we've made a decision.

67
00:05:25,325 --> 00:05:27,293
昨晚以后再不喝酒了
After last night, never drinking again.

68
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:28,987
如果我们想在明晚到达狼溪
We've got to get an early start

69
00:05:29,062 --> 00:05:31,530
就必须早早出发
if we want to get to Wolf Oreek By tomorrow night.

70
00:05:32,098 --> 00:05:33,759
嗯
Mm-hmm.

71
00:05:33,833 --> 00:05:35,858
别不信，我当然都检查过了
Piss off. Of course I checked.

72
00:05:35,935 --> 00:05:38,597
她是不是像一个纳粹头子？
How much of an organization Nazi is she?

73
00:05:38,671 --> 00:05:40,969
不，她说的对．9:30就睡觉
No, she's right. In Bed By 9:30.

74
00:05:56,222 --> 00:05:57,746
说实话，这样不好
This is Bad, actually.

75
00:05:58,825 --> 00:05:59,814
噢！
Oh!

76
00:06:00,460 --> 00:06:03,190
你不会喝的... 那是你的啤酒吧？
You weren't gonna drink that. Is that your Beer?

77
00:06:03,262 --> 00:06:05,628
- 我是亚齐，很高兴认识你 - 幸会
- Patrick. Pleased to meet you. - Nice to meet you.

78
00:06:05,698 --> 00:06:08,565

83
00:06:16,209 --> 00:06:18,143
你们想听他的烂故事吗
You gotta hear this Bullshit story.

84
00:06:18,378 --> 00:06:21,279
烂故事？这不是烂故事！

85
00:06:25,551 --> 00:06:27,985
乘风破浪！10尺高的浪花！

我想9:30早就过了

90
00:10:42,670 --> 00:10:45,177
《狼溪》

97
00:14:15,054 --> 00:14:17,784
当你给我做饭 当你给我打扫房间

他几个星期以来
He's Been playing guitar

100
00:14:23,796 --> 00:14:25,388
一直在弹吉它
? For a few weeks now

101
00:14:25,464 --> 00:14:27,762
他弹得真是烂啊

102
00:14:27,833 --> 00:14:30,495
真是烂

太美了
That's amazing.

108
00:14:47,286 --> 00:14:50,084
你知道你现在就在 世界第5大飞碟目击地点吧？
You're near the world's fifth Biggest UFO sighting area.

109
00:14:50,155 --> 00:14:52,646
-克里斯蒂，我说真的 - 是啊，我知道
-Kristy, I'm serious. - I know!

110

- 我听到你在笑！ - 什么？我是在听你说呢
- I can hear you laughing. - What? I'm listening.

111
00:14:55,594 --> 00:14:56,583
好吧

112
00:14:56,662 --> 00:14:58,857
- 我在听呢 - 告诉我们！
- I'm listening. - Tell us.

113
00:14:58,931 --> 00:15:01,229
别和她废话 告诉我吧，我听着呢
Don't listen to her. Tell me. I'm listening.

114
00:15:01,300 --> 00:15:02,824
好吧．我听说有个人
All right. I read aBout this guy

115
00:15:02,902 --> 00:15:05,097
在那边公路上开车
who was driving out on the highway out there.

116
00:15:05,170 --> 00:15:09,163
他看到前面有灯光 大约距离500米吧
And he sees this light ahead of him, around 500 meters,

117
00:15:09,241 --> 00:15:12,768
一开始他以为是卡车或者 半拖车什么的
and at first he thinks it's a truck or a semi-trailer or something,

118
00:15:12,845 --> 00:15:16,144
因为灯光太亮了，像是桔黄色的
'cause the light's really Bright, like glowing orange and shit.

119
00:15:16,215 --> 00:15:18,115
- 嗯 - 但是他接近后才发现
- Yeah. - But as he gets closer,

120
00:15:18,183 --> 00:15:22,779
灯光是在地上10米高处
he realizes that the light's aBout 10 meters off the ground,

121
00:15:22,855 --> 00:15:24,447
悬在空中
Just hanging in mid-air.

122
00:15:24,523 --> 00:15:27,720
所以他吓坏了 魂不附体
So he's scared, freaking out.

123
00:15:27,793 --> 00:15:30,455
然后他就听到一声“咯嚓”！
And then he hears this... crack!

124
00:15:31,697 --> 00:15:32,789
就像爆炸一样
Like an explosion.

125
00:15:32,865 --> 00:15:35,629
- 你是想吓我们吧 - 我知道，很吓人
- That was supposed to scare us. - I know, it's scary.

126
00:15:35,701 --> 00:15:37,862
他听到那声响确实吓坏了
But he did. He heard this crack.

127
00:15:37,937 --> 00:15:40,337
像是飞机发动机的声音
Like an explosion of a Jet.

128
00:15:40,406 --> 00:15:44,809
然后它就飞上天空 像火箭一样
And itJust took off into the sky, straight up like a rocket.

129
00:15:44,877 --> 00:15:47,471
它一走
And then as soon as it was gone,

130
00:15:47,546 --> 00:15:50,674
他的车就停在了马路中间
his carJust stopped in the middle of the road,

131
00:15:50,749 --> 00:15:53,217
一点声响都没有
and it was totally silent.

132
00:15:53,285 --> 00:15:57,654
他就坐在那里 往上看着星空
He was Just sitting there, staring up at the stars.

133
00:15:58,824 --> 00:16:00,587
在荒无一人的地方
In the middle of nowhere.

134
00:16:03,228 --> 00:16:05,788
- 嘿... - 没有任何原因，就停在那了
- Hey... - No reason. Just stopped.

135
00:16:05,864 --> 00:16:07,889
- 这个故事是真的吗？ - 当然！
- Is that a true story? - I read it.

136
00:16:07,967 --> 00:16:10,492
他有什么东西... 你嘴边有什么东西滴下来
You've got something dripping off your lip there.

137
00:16:10,569 --> 00:16:11,558
什么？
What?

138
00:16:11,637 --> 00:16:13,628
啊没什么，就是狗屎而已
Oh, it's all right. It's Just Bullshit.

139
00:16:13,706 --> 00:16:16,266
你才喷狗屎呢！
- No, Bullshit you, mate! - [Laughs]

140
00:16:29,221 --> 00:16:30,789
这是什么东西？
What's all this shit?

141
00:16:30,789 --> 00:16:32,347
- 哦，是帐篷 - 搭帐篷用的
- Oh, for the tent. - For the tent.

142
00:16:32,424 --> 00:16:35,291
- 我来吧，你去弄帐篷 - 不，你去弄帐篷
- Here, I'll do that. Start on the tent. - No, you do the tent.

143
00:16:40,699 --> 00:16:43,031
要是没有我，你们俩还能做什么
I don't know what you two would do without me.

144
00:16:44,903 --> 00:16:47,371
- 我还没喝完呢 - 哦，对不起
- I didn't finish that. - Oh, sorry.

145
00:16:47,439 --> 00:16:50,237
- 好了 - 我替你喝完了
- This is it. - I finished it for you.

146

173
00:20:47,879 --> 00:20:50,245
我想是那个店员

176
00:20:56,622 --> 00:20:59,853

I'm getting the feeling it's mutual. Am I wrong?

177
00:21:02,861 --> 00:21:04,496
你知道是真的

- 你介意么？ - 你知道的

179
00:21:07,165 --> 00:21:09,633
我想那真是很好的
I think it's aBsolutely faBulous.

180
00:21:10,836 --> 00:21:14,139
不要玩弄她，因为她真是好姑娘
But don't go dicking her around, Because she's totally Brilliant.

181
00:21:14,139 --> 00:21:16,699
如果你伤害了她，我就杀了你
If you hurt her, I'm going to have to kill you.

182
00:21:17,709 --> 00:21:20,269
所以我的建议是 我们三人一起好好玩
So my advice is that we have an awesome time together.

183
00:21:20,345 --> 00:21:22,905
你弄清楚你和你声称的那个女朋友
You sort out whatever it is going on Between you and this

184
00:21:22,981 --> 00:21:25,643
到底要怎么发展
so-called girlfriend you've allegedly got.

185
00:21:25,717 --> 00:21:31,383
等我们到达凯恩斯的时候 我也会找到很帅的男人
By the time we get to Oairns, we'll find some freakishly hot man for me,

186
00:21:31,456 --> 00:21:34,050
然后我们就在一起开心地玩 好不好？
and we'll all, you know, go crazy together, all right?

187
00:21:34,159 --> 00:21:36,457
好
All right.

188
00:21:37,296 --> 00:21:39,264
嗯，她真是个小姑娘，对不对？
She's only a little one, isn't she?

189
00:21:39,331 --> 00:21:42,164
我打赌我们可以很快搞定她
I reckon I could Break that in half real quickly, eh?

190
00:21:42,868 --> 00:21:44,301
嘿，你还是只会在旁边看

282
00:28:31,276 --> 00:28:34,302
是，真棒
Yeah. It's great. [laughs]

283
00:28:34,379 --> 00:28:36,074
对不起，我又不知道
Sorry. I didn't know.

284
00:28:39,451 --> 00:28:42,784
会晴天的，几个小时以后
It'll clear. Give it a couple of hours.

285
00:28:44,389 --> 00:28:45,856
谢谢你
Thank you.

286
00:28:53,031 --> 00:28:54,498
一会就回来
Back soon.

287
00:28:56,868 --> 00:28:58,563
你去哪？
Where are you going?

288
00:29:16,521 --> 00:29:19,547
我在想为什么流星要撞到这里
I wonder why the meteor hit here.

289
00:29:21,893 --> 00:29:24,828
就在这里，而不是其他地方
In this place. Nowhere else.

290
00:29:31,669 --> 00:29:35,605
也许它是被地球上 的什么东西吸引
MayBe it was drawn to something in the Earth.

291
00:29:37,509 --> 00:29:40,637
- 就像闪电击中地面 - 嗯
- Like when lightning strikes. - Hmm.

292
00:29:41,579 --> 00:29:44,446
- 什么？ - 嗯
- Yeah? - Hmm.

293
00:29:58,763 --> 00:30:01,698
- 嘿！ - 嘿！
- Hi. - Hey.

294
00:30:04,736 --> 00:30:06,727
真不错
[Ben panting] That's awesome.

295
00:31:04,229 --> 00:31:06,459
我在想那是什么滋味
I was wondering what that would Be like.

296
00:31:18,243 --> 00:31:20,711
克莉斯，几点了？
[Woman 1] Kris, what's the time?

297
00:31:20,778 --> 00:31:23,770
不知道，我的表停了
Uh, don't know. Watch has stopped.

298
00:31:24,749 --> 00:31:26,683
看起来像尼加拉瀑布！
It's like Niagara Falls!

299
00:31:30,488 --> 00:31:34,083
- 你知道几点了吗？ - 啊不知道，坏了
- Hey, have you got the time? - Nah. It's Busted.

300
00:31:35,226 --> 00:31:38,889
我说大概是7点 距离天黑还有一个小时
I'd say it's aBout 7:00. So aBout an hour till dark.

301
00:31:38,963 --> 00:31:40,954
放心，回到豪斯溪很容易
We'll make it Back to Halls Oreek, easy.

302
00:31:41,032 --> 00:31:43,262
克里斯蒂的表也停了
Kristy's watch stopped too.

303
00:31:44,936 --> 00:31:48,303
- 骗人...真的吗？ - 是的
- Bullshit. Did it really? - Yeah.

304
00:31:48,373 --> 00:31:51,536
6:30，我的也是
6:30. Mine too.

305
00:31:51,609 --> 00:31:53,577
怎么？是电池还是什么别的？
What, Batteries or something?

306
00:31:54,679 --> 00:31:56,806
钥匙在你那？
You got the keys?

307
00:32:00,818 --> 00:32:03,412
别忘了要预热
Make sure you warm her up first.

308
00:32:07,325 --> 00:32:10,920
- 天气很怪，是不是？ - 是啊，我也这么想
- [Ben] It's weird weather, eh? - [Woman 1] Yeah, I reckon. God.

309
00:32:11,095 --> 00:32:15,088
后会有期，狼溪
- [Keys Jangling] - [Ben] See you later, Wolf Oreek.

310
00:32:26,811 --> 00:32:28,904
- 怎么了？ - 我不知道
- What's wrong? - I don't know.

311
00:32:31,149 --> 00:32:32,582
我们忘了关灯吗？
Did we leave the lights on?

312
00:32:32,650 --> 00:32:35,278
没有
[Woman and Ben] No.

313
00:32:35,353 --> 00:32:37,617
是...是挂挡了吗？
Is it... Is it in gear?

314
00:32:37,689 --> 00:32:41,493
不，再试一次
- [Ben] No. Try... Try again. - [Key turning]

315
00:32:41,493 --> 00:32:41,720
不，再试一次
No. Try... Try again.

316
00:32:41,793 --> 00:32:43,920
啊，我操
Fuck.

317
00:32:46,097 --> 00:32:48,031
好...
OK.

318
00:32:48,099 --> 00:32:51,262
妈的
Shit.

319
00:32:51,469 --> 00:32:53,460
好了，打开前盖
Uh, pop... Pop the hood.

320
00:32:53,538 --> 00:32:55,802
可能就是电池接触不良
It's proBaBly Just the Battery terminals.

321
00:33:08,086 --> 00:33:09,485
这个...
This one...

322
00:33:14,125 --> 00:33:16,116
你知道你要找什么吗？
Do you know what you're looking for?

323
00:33:27,705 --> 00:33:29,297
你要告诉莉兹吗？
Are you gonna tell Liz?

324
00:33:29,374 --> 00:33:32,104
我感觉她已经知道了
[Chuckles] I've got a feeling she already knows.

325
00:33:32,176 --> 00:33:35,270
我看看我能做什么
I'll go see what I can do.

326
00:33:38,216 --> 00:33:40,207
你听到了么？
Did you hear that?

327
00:33:43,221 --> 00:33:45,348
- 你没有忘了关灯，是不是？ - 没有
- You didn't leave the lights on? - No.

328
00:33:45,423 --> 00:33:47,186
没有
No.

329
00:33:55,366 --> 00:33:56,594
妈的
Fucker.

330
00:33:57,835 --> 00:34:00,326
看起来我们要在这过夜了
Looks like we might Be spending the night.

331
00:34:03,241 --> 00:34:05,471
真他妈的
- This is fucked. - [Door slams]

332
00:34:05,543 --> 00:34:07,340
婊子
Bitch.

333
00:34:36,975 --> 00:34:38,636
我是你爸爸
I am your father.

334
00:34:54,859 --> 00:34:57,225
你认为这是不是有什么含义？
[Ben] Do you think it means anything?

335
00:34:59,831 --> 00:35:05,201
我是说... 表坏了，而且车发动不起来
I mean, the watches and the car not working.

336
00:35:07,138 --> 00:35:09,971
- 你什么意思？ - 好吧...
- What do you mean? - [Ben] Well...

337
00:35:10,041 --> 00:35:15,206
你知道我昨夜讲的故事 关于飞碟的
You know the stories I was telling you last night aBout the UFOs and stuff.

338
00:35:15,279 --> 00:35:18,771
而且 当飞碟在附近的时候
And when they were around,

339
00:35:19,584 --> 00:35:22,610
很多东西就不运行了
well, things stopped working.

340
00:35:24,622 --> 00:35:26,556
可能是碰到了同样的事情
[Ben] Oould Be the same kind of thing.

341
00:35:26,624 --> 00:35:30,424
本，我想我们现在 不应该谈论这些
Ben, I really don't think we need to Be talking aBout that right now.

342
00:35:32,397 --> 00:35:34,058
好
OK.

343
00:35:41,539 --> 00:35:43,302
那边有什么东西
There's something out there.

344
00:35:45,343 --> 00:35:48,369
- 而且不是人 - 不不，我真看到了一些光亮
- And it ain't no man. - No, no. I saw some lights.

345
00:35:48,479 --> 00:35:52,210
- 在哪儿？ - 就在那！在那...
- [Ben] Where? - Right... Right there.

346

- [Kristy] There. - [Ben] What the hell?

347
00:35:55,987 --> 00:35:57,682
不不不！不要...什么？
No, no, no. Don't fucking... What?

348
00:35:57,755 --> 00:36:00,417
- 它可能是一辆车！ - 它可能不是一辆车！
- [Kristy] It might Be a car! - Well, it might not Be a car!

349
00:36:01,893 --> 00:36:05,454
- 看起来根本不像车！ - 糟了，它往这边来了！
- [Ben] That don't look like no car. - [Liz] Shit. It's coming this way.

350
00:36:05,530 --> 00:36:07,259

- 我们应该逃跑吗？ - 不不不不！
- Should we run? - [Ben] No, no, no!

353
00:36:11,903 --> 00:36:14,133
在车里待着！
Just stay in the car! Don't move.

354
00:36:23,681 --> 00:36:26,275
不要动！ 等一下！它是一辆车！
Hold on. Hang on, it's a car.

355
00:36:26,350 --> 00:36:29,012
你怎么知道的？
[Kristy] How do you know?

356
00:36:29,087 --> 00:36:31,521
它绝对是辆汽车！
It's a Bloody car! Shit!

357
00:36:31,589 --> 00:36:34,490
你能听到发动机的声音
- I can hear the engine. - [Car approaching]

358
00:36:39,630 --> 00:36:41,222
[Engine stops]

359
00:36:52,143 --> 00:36:54,577
你们这帮人在这里 他妈的干什么呢？
What the Bloody hell are you moB doing out here?

360
00:36:54,679 --> 00:36:57,580
差点把我吓死！
- Scared the shit out of me. - [All laughing]

361
00:36:57,882 --> 00:36:59,782
我们以为是外星人呢
We thought it was aliens.

362
00:37:01,886 --> 00:37:05,413
- 嗯，她以为的 - 嘿
- Well, she did. - Hi.

363
00:37:05,420 --> 00:37:05,555
一开始雨下得很大，我正准备躲起来
It was pissing down with rain earlier. I was Just aBout to chuck it in.

364
00:37:08,860 --> 00:37:11,693

00:37:40,691 --> 00:37:44,024
啊，开个玩笑
Just playing with you, tiger.

377
00:37:44,095 --> 00:37:46,120
我从来没有去过那
Never Been over there myself.

378
00:37:46,197 --> 00:37:48,563
姑娘们你们够幸运 和小伙子一起旅行

379
00:37:48,633 --> 00:37:50,066

- I told you we'd Be all right. - I know. He's hilarious.

像澳大利亚内地的演员
He's like one of those guys from the outBack Australia shows.

383
00:38:02,413 --> 00:38:04,244
- 对！ - 鳄鱼邓迪！
- Yeah! - Like Orocodile Dundee.

384
00:38:04,315 --> 00:38:06,044
我看他是装的
He's a pisser.

385
00:38:06,117 --> 00:38:08,551
本，你也是澳大利亚人 为什么你说话不像他呢？
You're an Aussie. How come you don't talk like him?

386
00:38:08,619 --> 00:38:11,645
你们想听坏消息 还是特别坏的消息？
You want the Bad news? Or the really Bad news?

387
00:38:12,456 --> 00:38:15,721
高压线圈坏了 仙人掌划的...你们哪也去不了
Well, your coil's rooted. Oactus. You're not going nowhere.

- Ben. Fuck. - [Liz] Must Be something we can do.

390
00:38:21,232 --> 00:38:25,191
就是把旧的卸下来，新的装进去 然后就大功告成
You take the old one out, Bung the new one in, BoB's your sister.

391
00:38:25,269 --> 00:38:28,466
唯一的好消息就是 我有工具可以来做
The only good news is I got the gear to do it.

392
00:38:28,539 --> 00:38:31,269
问题是工具在我的营地 就在公路尽头
ProBlem is, it's Back at my camp Just down the road a ways.

393
00:38:31,342 --> 00:38:33,003
不过反正我要回去
I'm going Back down there anyway,

394
00:38:33,077 --> 00:38:35,875
所以可以拖着你们车 今夜修好

00:38:43,020 --> 00:38:45,352
不管怎样你们来决定 我要去嘘嘘先

- What do you guys want to do? - Might as well.

401
00:38:52,063 --> 00:38:53,928
他会免费修吗？
He's not going to fix it for free, is he?

402
00:38:53,998 --> 00:38:56,592
我是说如果 他要几百英镑什么的...
What if he wants a couple hundred pounds or something?

403
00:38:56,667 --> 00:38:59,636
- 1000呢？怎么办？ - 好
- A thousand, what? I don't know. - [Ben] OK, OK.

OK, first we gotta find out if he wants any money or not.

405
00:39:03,107 --> 00:39:05,735
- 我身上没有带很多现金 - 我也没有带
- I don't have a lot of cash on me. - Me, neither.

406
00:39:05,810 --> 00:39:07,471
我也是
Nor do I.

407
00:39:08,613 --> 00:39:10,240
唉
Duh.

408
00:39:11,949 --> 00:39:15,146
为什么不让他把我们车拖回镇上 然后我们找别人来修？
Why don't we get him to tow us to town, and we'll get someone there?

409
00:39:15,219 --> 00:39:16,208
对
Yeah.

410
00:39:19,790 --> 00:39:21,348
- 好 - 继续

411
00:39:21,425 --> 00:39:24,792
- 你去问他 - 我不想问他
- You go on, you ask him. - I don't want to.

412
00:39:24,862 --> 00:39:26,659
这是小伙子该做的 去吧
Go on. It's a Bloke thing. Go on.

413
00:39:26,731 --> 00:39:28,289
对你去问他
Yeah, you must. Please?

414
00:39:28,366 --> 00:39:29,799
- 嗯 - 这是小伙子该做的
- Yeah. - It's a Bloke thing.

415
00:39:31,002 --> 00:39:32,333
去问他
[Kristy] Ask him.

416
00:39:38,109 --> 00:39:41,510
- 你需要帮助吗？ - 不用，我很好
- [Ben] You didn't need any help? - Nah, I'm all right. Thanks, though.

417
00:39:41,579 --> 00:39:44,013
你知道这不能乱放的
Oertain way of putting it in.

418
00:39:45,216 --> 00:39:49,585
我知道路很长 但是姑娘们想
Um, I know it's a long way, But the girls were wondering

419
00:39:49,654 --> 00:39:51,315
求你把我们车拖回镇上
if you could tow us Back into town.

420
00:39:51,389 --> 00:39:54,415
我是说我们不好意思再麻烦你
I mean, we don't wanna put you out any more than we already have.

421
00:39:54,492 --> 00:39:56,426
我真的很想帮你们回到镇上
Look, I'd really like to help you, mate,

422
00:39:56,494 --> 00:39:58,359
不过我确实不往那边走
But I'm not heading that way, you know?

423
00:39:58,429 --> 00:40:01,887
如果你们不想搭车也无所谓 不过我就是往南边走
If you don't want the lift, that's up to you, But I'm heading south.

424
00:40:01,966 --> 00:40:03,866
- 南边... - 是的，南边
- South. - Yeah, south.

425
00:40:03,935 --> 00:40:05,197
南边
South.

426
00:40:05,269 --> 00:40:07,499
- 你想去北边 - 嗯
- You wanna go north. - Yeah.

427
00:40:07,571 --> 00:40:09,732
我要去南边
- I'm heading south. - [Both chuckling]

428
00:40:12,209 --> 00:40:13,608
嗯
Yeah.

429
00:40:13,678 --> 00:40:16,203
- 真不巧 - 不巧
- Bit of a Bugger. - Bugger. Yeah.

430
00:40:17,581 --> 00:40:19,879
那么...
[Ben] So, um...

431
00:40:24,188 --> 00:40:26,850
- 那么换高压线圈什么的 - 嗯？
- Well, with that coil... - Yeah?...and stuff...

432
00:40:29,293 --> 00:40:33,354
要花多少钱？
How much would that cost, say if we Just got you to do that?

433
00:40:33,431 --> 00:40:35,262
这不是皮特街
It's not fuckin' Pitt Street, mate!

434
00:40:35,333 --> 00:40:38,302
我不会收你钱的 你这个笨蛋
Of course I'm not gonna charge you, you stupid Bastard! Hey?

435
00:40:38,369 --> 00:40:42,499
你们听到了？ 多少钱？
[Laughs] You hear that? "How much?"

436
00:40:47,011 --> 00:40:48,569
嘿
Hey?

437
00:40:50,314 --> 00:40:53,977
- 啊，你确定吗？ - 啊老天，你想逗我乐吗
- [Ben] Oh, you sure? - Oh, Jesus, you make me laugh.

438
00:40:55,486 --> 00:40:57,784
你一定逗那两女孩开心 是不是？
You must keep the little Buggers amused, hey?

439
00:40:57,855 --> 00:40:58,981
是
Yeah.

440
00:40:59,056 --> 00:41:02,287
真是把我乐坏了
You amuse the Bloody BeJesus out of me.

441
00:41:02,493 --> 00:41:04,256
好吧，我去让女孩们做准备
All right. I'll get the girls going.

442
00:41:04,328 --> 00:41:06,796
- 不错，好主意 - 好主意
- That'd Be a good idea. - Yeah, good idea.

443
00:41:06,864 --> 00:41:08,491
- 那么你去吧 - 我去了
- Off you go. - Off I go.

444
00:41:08,566 --> 00:41:10,261
嘿
Yay.

445
00:41:15,172 --> 00:41:16,161
好吧
All right.

446
00:42:39,290 --> 00:42:40,689
[Sighs]

447
00:44:04,775 --> 00:44:06,936
他说他的地方在哪儿？
Where did he say his place was again?

448
00:44:07,011 --> 00:44:09,275
南边
South.

449
00:44:09,346 --> 00:44:11,780
感觉我们走了好几个小时了
It feels like we've Been driving for hours.

450
00:44:14,018 --> 00:44:15,542
嗯，应该不太远的
We shouldn't Be too far.

451
00:44:15,619 --> 00:44:17,985
你一小时前就说过了
That's what you said an hour ago.

452
00:44:18,055 --> 00:44:21,422
那么我们就让他 把我们扔在这里，好不好？
OK, let's Just get him to drop us off here then, all right?

453
00:44:26,664 --> 00:44:27,995
没问题的
It's cool.

454
00:44:28,065 --> 00:44:30,590
他说过要开一段的，不是吗？
He said it was gonna Be a Bit of a drive, didn't he?

455
00:44:30,668 --> 00:44:31,930
嗯
Mm-hmm.

456
00:44:34,238 --> 00:44:35,899
没问题
It's cool.

457
00:45:36,500 --> 00:45:39,162
一定是什么矿
Must Be some sort of mining operation.

458
00:45:39,236 --> 00:45:42,069
看起来像鬼镇
[Ben] Hmm. Looks like a ghost town.

459
00:46:09,900 --> 00:46:12,334
- 我们到了 - 谢天谢地
- We're here. - Thank God.

460
00:46:12,403 --> 00:46:13,768
不管这是哪里
Wherever here is.

461
00:46:21,045 --> 00:46:24,208
- 如果你们想喝，我这有很多水 - 谢谢
- [Man] I have plenty of water there. - [Liz] Aw, thank you.

462
00:46:24,281 --> 00:46:26,806
我们就缺水
It's the one thing that we don't have plenty of.

463
00:46:26,884 --> 00:46:28,283
干杯
[Ben] Oheers.

464
00:46:28,352 --> 00:46:31,446
没有什么水比山顶的雨水更好了
Nothing like rainwater from the top end.

465
00:46:31,522 --> 00:46:33,615
嘿，米克，这地方真不错
Hey, Mick, this place is amazing.

466
00:46:33,691 --> 00:46:36,819
真不敢相信他们就这么离开 留下这么多东西
I can't Believe they Just walked out and left all this stuff here.

467
00:46:36,894 --> 00:46:39,488
整个内地有好多这种地方
Plenty of places like this all over the outBack.

468
00:46:39,563 --> 00:46:42,760
上千处 人们都遗忘了的地方
Thousands of 'em. Places people've forgotten aBout.

469
00:46:42,833 --> 00:46:45,165
这附近本来有个镇的
[Mick] Must Be a whole town out there somewhere.

470
00:46:45,235 --> 00:46:48,033
在四十年代被一场 持续6个月的尘暴埋没了
Got lost in a six-month dust storm Back in the '40s.

471
00:46:48,105 --> 00:46:50,505
人们就离开了这里
The people Just walked away.

472
00:46:50,574 --> 00:46:53,304
我听说小伙子们 在自己的农场都能走丢
I heard of Blokes gettin' lost on their own farms.

473
00:46:53,377 --> 00:46:55,004
你知道，就是找不到出去的路
Just never found their way out.

474
00:46:55,079 --> 00:46:56,706
- 在他们自己的土地上？ - 嗯
- On their own property? - Mm-hmm.

475
00:46:56,780 --> 00:46:57,769
真有意思
That's amazing.

476
00:46:57,848 --> 00:47:00,749
这边有一个农场 横跨三个州是吗？
Oh, there's one up here that crosses three states, right?

477
00:47:00,818 --> 00:47:03,582
- 开车穿越要六天时间 - 不可能
- Takes six days to drive across. - No!

478
00:47:03,654 --> 00:47:05,781
我曾经在那里干过活
I... I... We used to work out there once.

479
00:47:05,856 --> 00:47:08,324
- 你在那做什么？ - 猎人
- What'd you do there? - Head shooter.

480
00:47:08,392 --> 00:47:10,155
你知道，清除野兽
You know, clearin' vermin.

481
00:47:10,227 --> 00:47:13,287
袋鼠，马，野猪，水牛...
Roos, horses, pigs, Buffalo. You name it.

482
00:47:13,364 --> 00:47:14,763
现在不干了
Don't work there no more.

483
00:47:17,334 --> 00:47:20,531
他们现在用毒药 不用猎人了
Use poisons. You know, instead of shooters.

484
00:47:20,604 --> 00:47:24,438
过去常常坐直升机
Yeah, used to... used to fly in with the helicopters.

485
00:47:24,508 --> 00:47:27,534
你在水牛群上空低飞
[Stuttering] You fly in low over a herd of water Buffalo.

486
00:47:27,611 --> 00:47:30,444
有时候一下午就杀掉50头
Sometimes take out 50 head in an afternoon.

487
00:47:30,514 --> 00:47:35,042
我的.303口径猎枪 一年用坏了5个枪栓！
I wore out five Bolts on a.303 one year.

488
00:47:35,853 --> 00:47:38,515
野猪，野猪是不一样的
Pigs. Pigs were different. You have to get in close.

489
00:47:38,589 --> 00:47:41,285
你必须接近它们，让狗先上 然后你拿刀上
Get the dogs onto 'em, and then you go in with a knife.

490
00:47:41,358 --> 00:47:45,351
当它和狗搏斗的时候 你必须接近它的腹部
You had to get in under him, you know, while the pig's fighting off the dogs.

491
00:47:45,429 --> 00:47:46,726
你必须要快
And you had to Be quick.

492
00:47:46,797 --> 00:47:48,958
不然它的獠牙 就把你肚肠挑出来
Otherwise, you'd lose your guts on its tusk.

493
00:47:49,032 --> 00:47:51,227
那獠牙很厉害！
- Sharp! - [Chuckles]

494
00:47:51,301 --> 00:47:53,531
我看到过一头大野猪
I seen a Big Boar pig, right?

495
00:47:53,604 --> 00:47:57,005
只一下就把猎狗脑袋削下来
Take a pitBull's head clean off one time.

496
00:47:58,442 --> 00:48:02,045
狗的小腿还在跑呢
Little legs still pumpin' away.

497
00:48:02,045 --> 00:48:03,171
噢！
Oh!

498
00:48:03,247 --> 00:48:05,078
- 骗你是小狗！ - 骗人是小狗？
- [Mick] Fair dinkum. - Fair dinkum?

499
00:48:05,149 --> 00:48:07,549
那是我说的
That's what I said, yeah.

500
00:48:07,618 --> 00:48:09,483
骗人是小狗
[Chuckling] Fair dinkum.

501
00:48:09,553 --> 00:48:12,420
可怜的小东西
Wow. Poor little fella.

502
00:48:16,693 --> 00:48:20,652
- 那么，你在哪住呢？ - 哦，我四处为家，你知道
- So, um, where do you live? - Oh, I get around, you know.

503
00:48:20,731 --> 00:48:23,700
根本不知道我会在哪里蹦出来
Never know where I might pop up.

504
00:48:27,805 --> 00:48:31,206
- 老兄，你一定热爱自由 - 什么？
- Man, you must love the freedom. - What?

505
00:48:31,275 --> 00:48:34,369
自由 你知道，你一定热爱它的
The freedom. You know, you must love it.

506
00:48:35,379 --> 00:48:37,677
你知道就是回归大自然什么的...
You know, hangin' out in nature and shit.

507
00:48:37,748 --> 00:48:40,216
- 对... - 对...
- [Mick] Right. - [Ben] Yeah.

508
00:48:40,284 --> 00:48:45,119
你喜欢的，你知道，是丛林生活
[Ben] You get to, like, you know, cruise around the Bush.

509
00:48:45,189 --> 00:48:50,786
说些很酷的话，比如 “那不是刀，这才是刀”（鳄鱼邓迪的台词）
Saying cool stuff like, "that's not a knife, this is a knife."

510
00:48:53,831 --> 00:48:56,265
你知道我在说什么吗？
[Ben] You know what I'm talking aBout? Yeah?

511
00:49:05,442 --> 00:49:08,775
你到底做什么呢...现在？
What do you actually do... now?

512
00:49:12,950 --> 00:49:17,353
我可以告诉你 不过然后我不得不杀了你
Oh, I could tell ya, But then I'd have to kill ya.

513
00:49:27,965 --> 00:49:30,331
那么你其实没有杀过袋鼠，是吗？
So you don't really shoot kangaroos, do you?

514
00:49:30,400 --> 00:49:33,858
我只是帮别人杀一些袋鼠
I'm doing people a service By taking out a few roos.

515
00:49:33,937 --> 00:49:36,030
它们现在遍地都是
They're everywhere out here now.

516
00:49:36,106 --> 00:49:37,903
就像旅游者
Like tourists.

517
00:49:50,821 --> 00:49:53,016
抱歉
Oh. Excusez moi.

518
00:49:54,324 --> 00:49:57,294
噢
- Oi.

519
00:49:57,294 --> 00:49:59,785
该你了
Oi. Your turn.

520
00:50:09,373 --> 00:50:11,534
不错
Fair go.

521
00:50:11,608 --> 00:50:13,132
小朋友，这还有女人呢！
Bloody women here, son.

522
00:50:19,716 --> 00:50:23,482
等修好了，我就告诉你们 怎么样？
Well, um, I'll let you know when I get it goin'. What do ya reckon?

523
00:50:23,554 --> 00:50:26,022
- 谢谢你 - 别放在心上
- Thank you. - [Mick] No worries.

524
00:50:26,089 --> 00:50:28,683
- 谢谢 - 谢谢

525
00:50:33,263 --> 00:50:34,753
“但是我不得不杀了你”
"But then I'd have to kill ya."

526
00:50:35,699 --> 00:50:36,859
嘘
Shh.

527
00:50:38,368 --> 00:50:39,357
怎么啦？
What?

528
00:50:39,436 --> 00:50:41,301
你没有看到他注视你的眼神吗？
Did you see the way he was looking at you?

529
00:50:41,371 --> 00:50:44,135
他只不过是想证明 他是个厉害的白人猎手
He's trying to impress us with his great white hunter thing.

530
00:50:44,207 --> 00:50:47,301
不错，但是他是在帮我们 可能不喜欢我们
But he's doing us a favor. He proBaBly doesn't appreciate us

531
00:50:47,377 --> 00:50:49,777
拿他的经历 开玩笑，我说真的
cracking Jokes at his expense. Seriously.

532
00:50:51,348 --> 00:50:54,146
- 我们就把车修好就成 - 我们不就是这么做的吗
- [Liz] Let's get the car fixed. - That's what we're doing.

533
00:50:54,217 --> 00:50:55,912
不要担心
Don't freak out.

534
00:51:09,466 --> 00:51:12,401
- 你没事？ - 还好，谢谢

再次感谢你帮我们
Thanks again for helping us out.

536
00:51:16,807 --> 00:51:18,365
不用了
No worries.

537
00:51:21,411 --> 00:51:24,505
显然我们走得越早越好
OBviously, it'd Be great to get going as soon as possiBle.

538
00:51:26,483 --> 00:51:28,348
别担心
No worries.

539
00:52:01,985 --> 00:52:03,509
本
Ben.

540
00:52:03,587 --> 00:52:06,522
本，把冷藏箱从火边拿开

723
01:23:49,057 --> 01:23:51,287
“那不是刀
[Mick] That's not a knife.

724
01:23:51,359 --> 01:23:54,453
这才是刀”
This is a knife.

725
01:24:00,669 --> 01:24:02,534
嘿！来吧，莉兹
[Mick] Now, come on. Oome on, Lizzie.

728
01:24:05,240 --> 01:24:07,606
那不会要你命的
That's not gonna kill ya. All right?

729
01:24:07,676 --> 01:24:11,112
现在我脖子挨了一枪 我哭了吗？没有
I got a Bullet hole in me neck and I'm not whingeing, am I? No.

730
01:24:13,081 --> 01:24:15,447
现在我不得不做点事，嗯...
I'm gonna have to do something, Lizzy.

731
01:24:15,517 --> 01:24:19,009
你知道这样 你就不会再试图逃跑了
So as you don't try and run out on me, you know?

732
01:24:19,087 --> 01:24:22,682
就是在越战中使用的 一个小技巧．你知道...
It's... It's a little trick they used to use in the Vietnam War, you know?

733
01:24:22,757 --> 01:24:24,156
他们能抓住俘虏
So they could take prisoners

734
01:24:24,225 --> 01:24:26,819
还能审问出情报...
and they still get the same information out of 'em.

735
01:24:26,895 --> 01:24:29,557
但是那帮混蛋却无法逃跑 你明白吗？
But the little Buggers didn't escape. You with me?

736
01:24:29,631 --> 01:24:31,360
你明白？
You with me?

737
01:24:31,700 --> 01:24:33,691
你明白我的意思了？嘿？

现在，这个小方法...
Now, this little procedure...

742
01:24:55,023 --> 01:24:57,787
就叫做“人头杖”
...is called "making a head on a stick."

743
01:24:59,060 --> 01:25:02,029
因为一旦你的脊椎被切断
Because once your spine's severed, right...

744
01:25:02,097 --> 01:25:03,587
不要！
