17
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:14,840
RACE CALLERS:
He's out by two lengths.

18
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,320
Holds 'em at bay.

19
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:18,880
And Mr Murphy takes out the
Guineas for Damien Oliver.

20
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:22,160
Fields Of Omagh fighting back
with Magical Miss. Yes! Omagh!

21
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:24,400
Toledo's the leader in the
Newmarket. And Toledo!

22
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:26,360
Toledo for Damien Oliver.

23
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:29,160
Fubu on the run on the inside.
Umrun, Mr Murphy charge.

24
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:31,080
Mr Murphy!
Oh, he's done it again.

25
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:33,360
Viscount coming at her.
Sunline in front.

26
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:35,440
Northerly on the outside
going at Sunline.

27
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:36,680
They got very tight,

28
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:38,280
but Northerly
wins the Cox Plate!

29
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:40,360
(Applause)

30
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:44,080
I'd like to call on

31
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:46,120
one of Western Australia's
leading jockeys,

32
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:48,600
Damien's brother, Jason,
to make the presentation.

33
00:02:57,560 --> 00:02:59,800
- Jason.
- Thanks, mate.

34
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:05,960
And they said
he'd never make it, hey?

35
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:07,640
Well, I did at least.

36
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:09,160
(Scattered laughter)

37
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:10,720
I was the one out there

38
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:12,200
riding professionally.

39
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:14,440
I was the one following
in our dad's footsteps.

40
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:16,600
And right in the middle
of my dream run,

41
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:18,800
my little brother races past

42
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:20,720
and leaves me in his dust.

43
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:22,200
Lately, he's been leaving

44
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:25,800
a few other people
in his dust as well.

45
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:31,160
But, Dame, my boy,
well done, mate.

46
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:33,520
We're all very proud of you.

47
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:40,360
Uh...

48
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:45,720
I'd like to thank the judges,
my beautiful girlfriend, Trish.

49
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,960
No need to tell me
I'm batting above my average.

50
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:50,920
(Audience chuckles)

51
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:54,320
My good mate and manager
Neil Pinner. Good on ya, Pins.

52
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:58,160
And to Lee Freedman,
the best trainer in the country.

53
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:01,360
- At least in his opinion.
(Audience laughs)

54
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:04,240
- Hey!
- And to my wonderful family.

55
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:08,960
Especially my mum and my nan,
watching this back in the west.

56
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:13,680
Mum, this is for you.

57
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:15,760
(Applause)

58
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:19,040
You too, Dad.

59
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:41,400
(Cheering and applause)

60
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:49,920
Ladies and gentlemen,
top jockey

61
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:51,960
and it's already gone
to his head.

62
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:54,720
Not happy with any of our horses
for this year's Melbourne Cup,

63
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:56,680
Damien is going to ride
for the enemy.

64
00:04:56,840 --> 00:04:59,400
Hey, excuse me.
Since when, Dame?

65
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:03,880
Well, Lee hasn't got
a horse running

66
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:07,560
and there's nothing much else
about, so...

67
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:10,640
Suddenly an offer came out of
the blue that I couldn't refuse.

68
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:13,360
(Audience murmurs)

69
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:16,640
Don't tell me
the Irish wizard Dermot Weld?

70
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:18,160
Maybe.

71
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:20,360
MAN: What about riding
an Aussie horse, Damien?

72
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:22,920
I wouldn't go so far
as to call my little brother

73
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:26,160
a dirty rotten traitor,
but there are some amongst us

74
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:29,720
who would consider Ireland's
foremost trainer just...

75
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:33,520
Well, you know.

76
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:46,760
(Clock strikes the hour)

77
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:53,080
Where's Vinnie?

78
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:56,040
Dress To Thrill? Media Puzzle?

79
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:58,080
(Snorts)

80
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:02,160
His people skills are
a little lacking, are they not?

81
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:04,240
I suppose it's understandable.

82
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:07,200
How about I take him out today?

83
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:09,720
Oh, thanks, Dave.

84
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:13,680
Hey. Easy now, big fella. Easy.

85
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:15,720
(Snorts)

86
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:18,480
That's it.

87
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:24,000
That's it. Steady now.

88
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:27,480
Time to go out
to the gallops, boy.

89
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:30,320
You wouldn't want to be left
behind now, would you?

90
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:39,520
Claire, have you something
to tell us?

91
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,160
It's Media Puzzle.
He's playing up again.

92
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:53,120
As a herding animal,
a horse is a creature of habit,

93
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:54,840
particularly so in the case

94
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,920
of thoroughbreds training
for the track.

95
00:06:57,080 --> 00:06:58,880
For, as we all know,

96
00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:02,800
particularly those in my employ
as long <i>as</i> Mr Phillips,

97
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:04,600
any deviation
in a horse's training

98
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:06,240
will have a significant impact

99
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:08,360
on its performance.

100
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:10,320
Surely we all know that.

101
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:13,080
We also know that runners
sired by Theatrical tend

102
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:15,240
to have a bit of a temper,

103
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:16,920
and this one's no exception.

104
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:19,000
Off you go.

105
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:38,600
Evolving Tactics.
Refuse To Bend.

106
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:42,840
Lovely, Dermot. Just lovely.

107
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:46,960
Two of your best, Michael.
Both in superb condition.

108
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:50,880
Dress To Thrill.
Top Of The Morning.

109
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:54,120
And who might
the third horse be?

110
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:57,800
Well, the important thing
is he's not one of yours.

111
00:07:57,960 --> 00:08:00,840
With the money I pay you,
I certainly hope not.

112
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:10,200
Vinnie Roe. Media Puzzle.

113
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:15,720
I hear you're taking Vinnie
to Australia.

114
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:19,280
Actually, Michael,
I'm taking both.

115
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:21,080
Media Puzzle?

116
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:23,080
I thought we decided he was
headed for the knackery.

117
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:25,400
It's taken him 18 months
to get his nerve back,

118
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:26,640
but believe me, it's back.

119
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:30,160
He's flying.
Remember the English St Leger?

120
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:31,120
Fourth.

121
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:33,200
A good fourth.
Plenty in the tank.

122
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:36,840
I'm telling you,
with the right jockey,

123
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:40,360
Media Puzzle could
win the Melbourne Cup.

124
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:46,960
- Proud of you, mate.
- Thanks, Jase.

125
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:51,040
You don't really mind me
riding for Dermot, do you?

126
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:55,080
Nah, maybe not. Which one of his
horses will you get to ride?

127
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:58,000
- Don't know yet.
- It's a bit of a blind date.

128
00:08:58,160 --> 00:08:59,120
The way I see it,

129
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:01,400
anything Dermot brings out
is going to be pretty good.

130
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:03,360
The rest is up to me.

131
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:05,320
Yeah, there's no doubt
the bloke's clever.

132
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:06,920
All I'm saying
is watch your back.

133
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:08,120
The man's full of bullshit.

134
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:10,200
Over there it's called
'blarney'.

135
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:12,640
Oh, is it? Well, it still
smells like crap over here.

136
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:13,560
Oh, he's OK.

137
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:16,000
You know, I rode for him
in Ireland a few years back.

138
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:18,600
There was an awful lot of chat,
but his horses were great.

139
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:24,360
Anyway, wouldn't be an issue
if you got a starter, would it?

140
00:09:24,520 --> 00:09:27,840
(Chuckles)
Might be time to hit the track.

141
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:31,240
Work him over. Six evens.
Home four. You too, Marty.

142
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:54,240
Hmm.

143
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:59,160
- What do you reckon?
- Yep. He'll do.

144
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:06,000
(Aeroplane landing)

145
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:13,040
RACE CALLER: ..and
it's Don Eduardo

146
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:14,840
and Carnegie Express
locked together.

147
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:18,320
Damien Oliver drives Don Eduardo
away and he's home,

148
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:20,760
ahead of Carnegie Express
and Pentastic.

149
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:23,520
Damien Oliver on Don Eduardo
wins the second...

150
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:25,720
MAN: Qantas 47,
contact Sydney departures...

151
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:35,240
RACE CALLER: Now riding
in the Gooree colours,

152
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:36,680
for the second time
this afternoon

153
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:37,840
Damien Oliver heads out,

154
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:41,040
chasing a rare double, winners
in two cities just hours apart.

155
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:42,960
Oliver has control of the race
on Chong Tong.

156
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:44,480
He's out by a couple of lengths.

157
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:46,280
He's got it well won.

158
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:48,560
Damien, straight
from Randwick to Flemington,

159
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:50,520
makes it a twin-city double.

160
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:53,240
(Cheering)
- Told you.

161
00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:56,200
Thank you.

162
00:10:57,960 --> 00:11:00,280
NEWSREADER: In local news,
the Australian Democrats

163
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:03,440
could be without a new deputy
leader until mid-November,

164
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:04,800
after none of the...

165
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:08,040
Someone could do with
an early night.

166
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:10,560
Um... Yeah, I'd love to.

167
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:14,000
Unfortunately, the Eagles
are playing North at the Dome

168
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:16,720
and Jason's flying back
especially, which is terrible,

169
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:18,080
because I hate football.

170
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:20,040
- Sure.
- Mwah!

171
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:23,280
- He's crazy. You both are.
- Runs in the family. Love you.

172
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:25,360
- Love you.
- Go, Eagles!

173
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:29,280
CROWD: Eagles! Eagles!
(Crowd roars)

174
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:35,440
JASON: Go, Kerr! Go!
DAMIEN: Come on, Kerr! Come on!

175
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:39,080
Daniel Kerr down towards the 50.

176
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:41,200
Archer makes the decision,
comes to him.

177
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:43,360
BOTH: Oh...

178
00:11:43,520 --> 00:11:47,280
And pass to Priddis. Tackled by
Sinclair. Oh, wonderful by Judd.

179
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:49,600
- Go, Juddy! Go, Juddy!
- Oh, Juddy. Come on, Juddy!

180
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:52,320
JASON: Come on, Juddy!
DAMIEN: To Lynch! Goes to Lynch!

181
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:55,560
The long bomb for the game!
Oh, he's hit the post!

182
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:57,640
ALL: Oh...

183
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:03,440
Scores are tied up. 102 apiece.
The Kangaroos and the Eagles.

184
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:06,400
Jason McCartney brings it back
for North Melbourne.

185
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:09,880
DAMIEN: Go, Cuz. Go, Cuzza!
JASON: Go Cuz! Look, look!

186
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:14,000
BOTH: Yes!
JASON: Go! Go!

187
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:17,400
JASON: Yes, pass!

188
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:19,720
For the long kick forward
to the full-forward zone.

189
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:24,160
ANNOUNCER: McCartney!
CROWD: Oh...

190
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:26,680
JASON: Would somebody, anybody,
please stop McCartney?

191
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:28,640
He's murdering us!

192
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:30,160
Back come the West Coast Eagles.

193
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:32,040
Short one finds Hansen
on the lead.

194
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:34,240
JASON: Go, Juddy! Go, Juddy!

195
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:36,240
BOTH: Juddy! Come on! Go!

196
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:39,160
JASON: Juddy! Come on, Juddy!

197
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:42,000
CROWD: Oh...
(Crowd roars)

198
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:44,760
(Horn)

199
00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:48,040
The West Coast Eagles have
won it in the dying seconds.

200
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:49,920
What a remarkable game
of football.

201
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:51,400
- Yeah!
- What did I tell you?

202
00:12:51,560 --> 00:12:52,840
Fifty bucks says
we win the flag.

203
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,120
Come on, let's head down
the rooms and see the boys.

204
00:12:55,280 --> 00:12:56,240
Whoo!

205
00:12:58,440 --> 00:13:01,320
- Sorry, buddy. In a rush.
- Hey! Who have we got here?

206
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:04,600
One of your biggest fans,
Mr Oliver. My grandson.

207
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:07,160
- Go ahead. Say g'day, son.
- G'day, mate.

208
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:09,400
Grandad's back's
a little bit more welcoming.

209
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:11,560
(All chuckle)
- Ah. Jason Oliver.

210
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:13,840
- A man who knows his racing.
- Better yet, a West Australian.

211
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:14,800
JASON: Nice.

212
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:16,760
I saw your father win
the Perth Cup.

213
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:19,440
And your grandfather win the
Kalgoorlie back in '65, yeah.

214
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:21,400
A bit before your time,
of course.

215
00:13:21,560 --> 00:13:23,520
If you wouldn't mind a picture
with this fellow.

216
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:25,480
DAMIEN: Not at all. Here we go.
JASON: Sure.

217
00:13:25,640 --> 00:13:28,200
- Would mean a lot to us.
DAMIEN: Mate, big smile.

218
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:33,920
RACE CALLER:
..and Pugin continues in front,

219
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:37,040
being followed by Ballingarry
and Vinnie Roe.

220
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:38,960
Warrsan and Millenary are next,

221
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:40,880
and then Queens Wharf,
Margarula.

222
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:42,560
Couple of lengths
to Sadlers Wings.

223
00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:45,280
Half a mile to go as they make
the entrance to the straight

224
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:48,120
in the Jefferson Smurf it
Memorial Irish St Leger...

225
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:51,680
Steady, Pat. Don't get boxed in.

226
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:55,000
Then comes Margarula,
Queen's Wharf, Sadlers Wings.

227
00:13:55,160 --> 00:13:56,520
They turn their heads for home.

228
00:13:56,680 --> 00:13:58,680
Pugin still in front
of Ballingarry.

229
00:13:58,840 --> 00:14:01,200
Vinnie Roe towards
the outside in third.

230
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:04,040
- Now.
- Millenary 4 and Warrsan 5.

231
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:05,520
Passing the turn now,
and Pugin's...

232
00:14:05,640 --> 00:14:07,040
He's going to do it, Dermot!

233
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:08,480
Vinnie Roe, last year's winner,

234
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:10,680
making ground now towards
the final furlong.

235
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:12,880
And Vinnie Roe clinging
to the front...

236
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:14,840
He's yours, Pugin. Take him!

237
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:16,800
RACE CALLER:
They're inside the last 200.

238
00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:19,200
- It's Vinnie Roe in front...
- Bring him home, lad.

239
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:22,040
CALLER: ..Balingarry and Warrsan
going up towards the line.

240
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:23,720
Vinnie Roe wins
back-to-back Legers

241
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:25,880
for Pat Smullen
and Dermot Weld.

242
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:28,000
Second Pugin,
Balingarry and Warrsan.

243
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:31,600
(Horse neighs, applause)

244
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:34,560
What's next? Will Vinnie go to
Paris? Will he run in the Arc?

245
00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:36,960
We'll just take our breath
and admire ourselves first

246
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:39,520
for winning the St Leger for
the second time, I might add.

247
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:41,360
Were you worried, Dermot,
at the halfway mark,

248
00:14:41,520 --> 00:14:42,800
given Vinnie's slow start?

249
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:45,840
Now, now, Sean thought you'd
know they don't give ribbons out

250
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,160
for which horse is in what place
at the halfway mark.

251
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:50,560
At the Curragh, Sean,
as pretty much everywhere else.

252
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:52,280
What matters is how they finish.

253
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:54,200
Dermot, is there any truth
in the rumour

254
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:56,600
you're taking Media Puzzle
to Australia with Vinnie?

255
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:58,520
There is. It's more company
for Vinnie.

256
00:14:58,680 --> 00:15:00,000
They're stablemates -
great friends.

257
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:02,120
But he hasn't won anything
in years.

258
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:05,480
This is true. Not like
our Vinnie. (Laughs)

259
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:07,880
Oh, you champ. How'd he pull up?

260
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:10,000
If he had his way,
he'd run in the next race.

261
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:11,680
Couldn't ask
for a better ride, Pat.

262
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:13,360
Couldn't have asked
for a better horse.

263
00:15:13,560 --> 00:15:14,840
Australia? ls Vinnie good enough

264
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,720
to take them on
in the Melbourne Cup?

265
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:18,760
Ah, I wouldn't say that.

266
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:22,320
- He's good enough to win it.
(Both chuckle)

267
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:24,360
This way, gentlemen.
This way, please.

I Middle-Eastern-themed music

269

- Wa Alaykum-us-Salam, Emir.

270
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,880
(Both speak Arabic)

271
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:04,440
(Laughs) You know, I had a rag
doll in better shape than you.

272
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:07,120
Who are you calling
in bad shape? (Grunts)

273
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:09,160
(Laughs)

274
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:12,320
Nah, they're just
a few reminders.

275
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:18,160
It's my CV. Oaks Day '95,
Melbourne. Broken collarbone.

276
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:23,280
Perth '91 broken wrist.
Perth '88 ankle.

277
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:25,240
You sound almost proud of them.

278
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:27,760
Nah, I'm just happy
to have survived.

279
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:30,960
How can you avoid it?

280
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:33,880
Sometimes you can't.
Sometimes you can.

281
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:36,160
- Just part of the business.
- Hmm.

282
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:38,800
Sometimes I wonder
if it's all worth it.

283
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:40,840
It is.

284
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:44,480
- And so are you.
- (Laughs) Don't.

watching your brother
three-putt this shot.

306

'Cause let's face it Tiger
Woods couldn't make this putt.

307
00:18:51,560 --> 00:18:52,960
JASON: No-one could sink
this putt

308
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:54,720
with all the racket
you're making.

309
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:07,360
JASON: It's perfect, my boy.
DAMIEN: Get over there.

00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:09,440

with the last shot of the match!

- JASON: Oh, whoa, oh, oh.
- (Lee chuckles)

LEE: Missed it! Bad luck.
Oh, no!

NEIL: He didn't, did he?

316
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:23,240

Oh, yes, he did.

(Damien laughs)
- Oh, yes!

318
00:19:26,360 --> 00:19:28,960
It's not the prettiest shot,
but I'll take what I can get.

319
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:31,600
You're doing that already,
aren't you, with that Irishman?

320
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:33,560
Ah, here we go.

Who's one of the best trainers

It's good for Damien, is it?

324

You're his manager -
you should know better.

for is Dermot Weld.

326
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:43,840
Vinnie Roe's won every
stakes race in Europe.

327
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,280
Don't think for a moment

328
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:47,200
you're even going to get
to sit on that horse.

329
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:49,160
Dermot's got Pat Smullen
for Vinnie.

330
00:19:49,320 --> 00:19:51,720
- No, for you he's got...
- Media Puzzle. I know.

331
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:53,240
The owners want me
to ride Vinnie Roe.

332
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:54,680
I've even spoken to Dermot.

333
00:19:54,840 --> 00:19:56,160
He's fixed on me
riding Media Puzzle.

334
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:57,280
That horse is a dog.

335
00:19:57,480 --> 00:19:59,360
If Dermot's bringing him out,
he's no slouch.

336
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:01,760
That horse sat out all of
last year with a broken pelvis!

337
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:03,400
He hasn't even qualified,
has he?

338
00:20:03,560 --> 00:20:05,040
We're gonna qualify him
at Geelong.

339
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:07,120
You hope.

340
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:10,880
Does he always get this mad
when he has to buy the beers?

341
00:20:11,040 --> 00:20:13,640
No, no. He gets this mad because
he always has to buy the beers.

342
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:15,080
I mean, for all we know,

343
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:16,880
Media Puzzle will break down
<i>as</i> soon as he arrives.

344
00:20:17,080 --> 00:20:18,280
And suddenly Australia's
top jockey

345
00:20:18,440 --> 00:20:19,960
doesn't have a ride in the Cup.

346
00:20:25,080 --> 00:20:26,520
Yeah, but see,
that's not the point.

347
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:27,840
You've got to be clear, Dave.

348
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,040
You can't be behind-the-door
with these people.

349
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:31,400
I know, boss. I understand.

350
00:20:31,560 --> 00:20:33,040
No, that's it.
You don't understand.

351
00:20:33,160 --> 00:20:35,160
You're not asking somebody
to part with 30,000 euro

352
00:20:35,320 --> 00:20:37,120
to bring a horse
halfway round the globe.

353
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:39,520
He's not doing it because
he believes in the horse.

354
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:42,040
He's doing it because
he believes in us.

355
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:44,560
You damn well better make sure
his faith is justified.

356
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:46,720
- It will be.
- I hope so.

357
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:48,960
I really do, Dave. You know?

358
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:50,920
I'm relying on you now
to communicate exactly...

359
00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:51,920
not approximately...

360
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:54,520
exactly my instructions
to the handlers and jockeys.

361
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:56,960
Let them know who's boss.

362
00:20:57,120 --> 00:20:58,920
Until I get there,
you're my eyes and ears.

363
00:20:59,080 --> 00:21:01,360
I need to know everything,
absolutely everything now.

364
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:03,320
- Is that clear?
- Everything.

365
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:06,240
OK. You have a flight to catch.
See you in Australia.

- Of course.

368
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:21,120
Do watch out
for those Australian women.

369
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:23,440
Look at your brother Niall.
He went for three weeks.

370
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:26,080
- We haven't seen him since.
- They did offer him a good job.

371
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:31,760
Ha! So he says. You just make
sure they don't offer you one.

372
00:21:32,680 --> 00:21:36,000
My job's here with you
That's the way I like it

373
00:21:37,040 --> 00:21:38,960
I hope so.

- Thanks.
- Hey, brother.

00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:38,720
- How are you?
- Could be a whole lot worse.

382

- Good. Long.

But how do you rate
their chances, Bart?

416

Well, they should do well. We
treat 'em like bloody royalty.

Damien. Good to see you again.

No prize for guessing
who this is.

Yeah, I don't mind that.

Guess you didn't come here
for the scenery, did you, mate?

Good boy. That's a fella.

More than ready
for a decent blow, I'd say.

JASON: Good, thanks.

480
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:25,520
RACE CALLER: Jockeys about
to be legged up for race 6.

481
00:29:25,640 --> 00:29:28,400
Lady Avonlea well in the
markets. So too Kazz B.

482
00:29:28,520 --> 00:29:31,360
Along with Cossack Angel
and Picture Skew.

483
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:34,560
About to head out
at Belmont for race 6.

484
00:29:41,640 --> 00:29:43,920
RACE CALLER: ..Miss Domani
last one to move into line.

485
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:45,360
Last horseriders.

486
00:29:45,560 --> 00:29:48,080
And they're just about to do
the Belmont, race 6. Good line.

487
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:51,400
The outer range underway quickly

488
00:29:51,560 --> 00:29:53,480
with Kazz B
and also Lady Avonlea.

489
00:29:53,640 --> 00:29:56,280
Rose Of Oakford racing,
handy ride by Cossack Angel.

490
00:29:56,440 --> 00:29:58,360
(Hoofs drown speech)

491
00:29:59,040 --> 00:30:01,960
Kazz B going for the lead.
From the outside, Our Doreen.

492
00:30:02,120 --> 00:30:03,720
It's Cossack Angel,
followed by Miss Domani,

493
00:30:03,880 --> 00:30:05,040
approaching the turn.

494
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:08,000
Kazz just in front as Jason
Oliver pulls towards the outside

495
00:30:08,160 --> 00:30:09,360
on Lady Avonlea.

496
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:12,400
- Here she comes on the outside.
(Cheering)

497
00:30:12,560 --> 00:30:13,400
Our Doreen.

498
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:16,000
But Jason Oliver has handled
the field on Lady Avonlea.

499
00:30:16,160 --> 00:30:18,400
Ran from the behind
and has got up to win.

500
00:30:18,560 --> 00:30:20,320
Lady Avonlea.
Perfect ride by J Oliver.

501
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:22,240
Got up to win from Kazz B.

502
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:25,480
And Our Doreen makes a third.

503
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:28,880
TV ANCHOR: Despite burns
to over 50% of his body,

504
00:30:29,040 --> 00:30:30,560
the North Melbourne star
helped friends escape

505
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:31,960
from the burning bar,

506
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:34,600
to await evacuation
by the Australian Air Force.

507
00:30:34,760 --> 00:30:36,560
On two occasions, McCartney...

508
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:38,520
Me and Jason
were in that game last month.

509
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:40,960
TV ANCHOR: ..he insisted
someone else go in his place.

510
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:45,800
Now, Jason McCartney is back in
Australia fighting for his life.

511
00:30:45,960 --> 00:30:46,760
Incredible.

512
00:30:46,920 --> 00:30:51,040
How could anyone be so brave
in the middle of that inferno?

513
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:53,120
The man's a star.

514
00:30:54,360 --> 00:30:57,240
(Phone rings)

515
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:05,760
G'day, Jase. Nice win, my boy.
How about McCartney?

516
00:31:05,880 --> 00:31:06,680
Paddy's Bar.

517
00:31:06,840 --> 00:31:08,680
Wasn't that near where you
and Trish stayed last year?

518
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:12,040
Yeah, yeah. It's a great spot.
Was there every night.

519
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:15,160
Hey, listen, Dame, I just want
to speak to you about tomorrow.

520
00:31:15,320 --> 00:31:17,880
Now, I know a lot's changed
since my days in Geelong,

521
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,400
but I'll bet you my bottom
dollar that last turn hasn't.

522
00:31:20,560 --> 00:31:22,600
Far as I know.

523
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:25,960
See, the thing is,

524
00:31:26,120 --> 00:31:28,680
if you're not up front with
the leaders on that last turn,

525
00:31:28,840 --> 00:31:31,320
you might as well ride him
straight back to the stalls.

526
00:31:31,480 --> 00:31:33,840
- What, is that it?
- Yeah, that's it.

527
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,320
'Cause if you blow it, you'll
be making 5% of bugger all,

528
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:39,360
watching the Cup from an
armchair like the rest of us.

529
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:43,200
CALLER: Candidates are parading
now for the big one today,

530
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:45,200
the Geelong Cup runners
in the mounting yard

531
00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:46,960
for the 2002 Geelong Cup.

532
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:49,800
And jockeys are about to mount
up. We have 2 riding changes...

533
00:31:49,960 --> 00:31:53,080
(Media Puzzle squeals, snorts)

534
00:31:53,240 --> 00:31:55,720
He's not short on spirit-
that's for sure.

535
00:31:55,880 --> 00:31:57,400
Has he got anything left?

536
00:31:57,560 --> 00:31:59,640
At least you know
he's got plenty of kick in him.

537
00:31:59,800 --> 00:32:02,760
You'll need it when you make
your move on the home straight.

538
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:05,520
- No way.
- What?

539
00:32:05,680 --> 00:32:08,240
- This is my home track.
- And?

540
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:10,680
If Damien waits till the home
straight to make his move,

541
00:32:10,840 --> 00:32:13,000
he'll be looking at a wall
of ten horses wide.

542
00:32:13,160 --> 00:32:15,760
I've seen it too many times.
That's the short straight.

543
00:32:15,920 --> 00:32:18,360
If a hole doesn't open on the
rail, he'll have to swing wide,

544
00:32:18,520 --> 00:32:20,680
and, by then, it's too late.

545
00:32:20,840 --> 00:32:24,400
Well, you know, that mightn't be
the way Dermot sees it.

546
00:32:24,560 --> 00:32:28,360
If it's any consolation, my
brother raced here a fair bit.

547
00:32:28,520 --> 00:32:30,160
<i>He says the same thing.</i>

548
00:32:30,320 --> 00:32:33,680
You... you do realise
what you'd be asking of me.

549
00:32:33,800 --> 00:32:35,280
Mm. That I do, brother.

550
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:37,800
To go against Dermot's orders.
Just a whisker.

551
00:32:37,960 --> 00:32:41,040
- If I alter his instructions...
- And do anything but win...

552
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:43,000
Mate, you'd be fired?

553
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:45,440
That wouldn't be very Irish,
Damien. Far too merciful.

554
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:48,360
(Phone rings)
- That'll be him.

555
00:32:49,360 --> 00:32:53,240
Look, Dermot will keep him on.
I've no doubt about that.

556
00:32:53,400 --> 00:32:55,760
I also know for the rest of his
days, Dermot will have him

557
00:32:55,920 --> 00:32:57,000
with the worst horses

558
00:32:57,160 --> 00:32:59,280
at every two-bit pitch-and-toss
meeting in Ireland.

559
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:02,080
In the dead of winter.

560
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:03,880
DAVE: Guess what.

561
00:33:04,040 --> 00:33:06,240
He wants you to fall off the
pace <i>as</i> soon as possible

562
00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:09,560
and don't make a move
until the home straight.

563
00:33:09,720 --> 00:33:11,640
Righto.

564
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:18,440
RACE CALLER: Jockeys are up.

565
00:33:18,600 --> 00:33:20,720
Field's about to parade now,
ladies and gentlemen.

566
00:33:20,840 --> 00:33:22,880
Cyclades, the top-placed
from New Zealand...

567
00:33:23,040 --> 00:33:24,440
So, what's it gonna be?

568
00:33:24,600 --> 00:33:26,600
We really going
with Dermot's instructions?

569
00:33:33,640 --> 00:33:38,000
(Chuckles) Good on you, mate.
Now we're playing Aussie Rules.

570
00:33:43,280 --> 00:33:45,200
(Phone rings)

571
00:33:47,160 --> 00:33:49,680
- Yep?
- We're ready to race.

572
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:52,520
And Damien understands
our strategy?

573
00:33:52,680 --> 00:33:55,280
One hundred per cent.

574
00:33:55,440 --> 00:33:56,880
CALLER: Old Tawny
into the outside gate.

575
00:33:57,040 --> 00:33:58,400
We're set for a start.

576
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:03,240
They've jumped at a good line.

577
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:06,040
National Treasure came out
quickly on the inside...

578
00:34:06,200 --> 00:34:08,920
Clean break.
We're in good shape.

579
00:34:09,080 --> 00:34:11,080
Is he falling off the pace?

580
00:34:11,200 --> 00:34:14,080
Not yet. They're coming down the
straight for the first time.

581
00:34:21,720 --> 00:34:25,200
Then comes next Media Puzzle,
over on the outside...

582
00:34:25,360 --> 00:34:27,920
DERMOT: He was supposed to fall
off the pace at the very start.

583
00:34:28,080 --> 00:34:29,920
- You told him that, right?
- I swear to God.

584
00:34:30,080 --> 00:34:32,640
They're into the first turn.

585
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:35,600
- How far has he fallen back?
- He's...

586
00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:41,160
- ..fifth or sixth.
- Oh, God damn it!

587
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:44,760
He's not happy.
I'll get you a job over here.

588
00:34:44,880 --> 00:34:46,640
Honest, boss I did tell Damien
your instructions

589
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:48,840
were to drop back
as quickly <i>as</i> he could.

590
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:50,360
He'll drop back alright, yeah.

591
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:52,840
As soon <i>as</i> he sees
the finish line.

592
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:54,520
Come on, big fella.

593
00:34:54,680 --> 00:34:55,920
CALLER: L'Avenir in front,

594
00:34:56,040 --> 00:34:58,000
leading by eight lengths
to Lightuma.

595
00:34:58,160 --> 00:35:00,680
Two lengths third is Freegold,
followed by Southern Crown.

596
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:04,600
One and a half Requiem. Two away
then was Media Puzzle...

597
00:35:04,760 --> 00:35:06,560
Tell me I didn't just hear that

598
00:35:06,760 --> 00:35:08,440
Unfortunately, you did.

599
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:11,120
David, didn't I tell you

600
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:13,000
how difficult it is
to convince an owner

601
00:35:13,160 --> 00:35:14,960
to bring a horse
halfway around the world?

602
00:35:15,160 --> 00:35:16,920
- But, Dermot...
- I told you!

603
00:35:17,120 --> 00:35:22,640
It's not the money. It's the
confidence, in me! In you.

604
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:24,960
CALLER: ..by six or seven
lengths to Lightuma.

605
00:35:25,080 --> 00:35:27,160
Two away, third Freegold,
Southern Crown,

606
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:29,680
then Media Puzzle
one and a half from the back

607
00:35:29,840 --> 00:35:32,960
followed by Piachay,
and L'Avenir...

608
00:35:33,120 --> 00:35:37,120
NIALL: He's there. He's there!
- He could be.

609
00:35:37,240 --> 00:35:39,400
Now they jam up,
followed by Media Puzzle...

610
00:35:39,560 --> 00:35:41,320
Media Puzzle's battling
for first!

611
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:44,440
Forlorna making a run with
Piachay. And further back...

612
00:35:44,600 --> 00:35:46,520
He's taken the lead!
He's pulling away!

613
00:35:46,640 --> 00:35:47,680
And it's Media Puzzle...

614
00:35:47,840 --> 00:35:49,760
Come on!

615
00:35:49,960 --> 00:35:51,760
Piachay's starting
to give chase.

616
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:53,440
Come on, Damien! Come on!

617
00:35:53,600 --> 00:35:55,120
Yes! He's flying down
the straight!

618
00:35:55,280 --> 00:35:58,400
(Muffled) He's gonna win it
for us! Yes!

619
00:35:58,560 --> 00:36:00,480
- Piachay, Southern Crown...
- Yes!

620
00:36:00,600 --> 00:36:02,600
- Old Tawny from back...
(Both cheer)

621
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:04,960
- But it's Media Puzzle...
- You're in the Cup, my boy.

622
00:36:05,120 --> 00:36:07,000
Media Puzzle wins
by three lengths.

623
00:36:07,120 --> 00:36:10,560
Oh, Damien, you little champion!

624
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:18,040
DAVE: Did you hear that?
A new track record!

625
00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:20,720
Confidence, Dave.

626
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:24,320
Like I said, it's all about
confidence.

627
00:36:30,240 --> 00:36:32,480
I just hope those Irish
appreciate what they've got.

628
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:34,440
Well done, mate.
Fan-bloody-tastic.

629
00:36:34,600 --> 00:36:36,160
Couldn't have done it
without you, Jase.

630
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:37,720
Your tip made
all the difference.

631
00:36:37,880 --> 00:36:39,680
Looks like you owe me
that bottom dollar.

632
00:36:39,840 --> 00:36:42,360
(Chuckles) It's yours, my boy.

633
00:36:42,520 --> 00:36:46,200
Jason, Dave again.
He's going in.

634
00:36:48,360 --> 00:36:50,200
TV ANCHOR:
High spirits in the Irish camp,

635
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:52,760
following Media Puzzle's
runaway victory.

636
00:36:52,920 --> 00:36:55,800
Next week's Melbourne Cup was
shaping up as a two-horse race

637
00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:58,520
between Weld's Vinnie Roe
and Pugin,

638
00:36:58,640 --> 00:37:01,600
the standard bearer of Sheikh
Mohammed's Godolphin Stables.

639
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:04,760
But now the Irish Wizard
may well have the upper hand,

640
00:37:04,920 --> 00:37:06,840
as he readies not one

641
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:10,120
but two formidable entries
for next week's Cup.

642
00:37:10,280 --> 00:37:11,720
REPORTER: But nothing
can detract

643
00:37:11,840 --> 00:37:13,320
from the horrors of Bali.

644
00:37:13,480 --> 00:37:15,960
All Australia is in mourning.

645
00:37:16,120 --> 00:37:18,960
Melbourne's Spring Street
was awash with flowers.

646
00:37:19,120 --> 00:37:21,120
They may not have known
the Bali victims,

647
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:24,080
but for many Australians
there is a deep connection...

648
00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:27,000
the fact that so many died
so close to home.

649
00:37:29,560 --> 00:37:30,880
May I remind you all

650
00:37:31,080 --> 00:37:32,720
this is a barrier trial?

651
00:37:32,920 --> 00:37:34,680
Now, it might sound odd,
gentlemen,

652
00:37:34,840 --> 00:37:36,280
but the point of this exercise

653
00:37:36,440 --> 00:37:39,080
is to get horses that have never
been near a starting gate

654
00:37:39,240 --> 00:37:41,600
and to actually get them
inside one.

655
00:37:41,720 --> 00:37:43,680
When that happens,
if that happens,

656
00:37:43,840 --> 00:37:46,560
we might even show 'em
how to start.

657
00:37:46,720 --> 00:37:49,600
Easy, easy, easy, easy...

658
00:37:58,840 --> 00:38:01,040
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

659
00:38:06,200 --> 00:38:08,120
Last horse in.

660
00:38:43,480 --> 00:38:46,040
33-year-old male jockey.
Horse came down on him.

661
00:38:46,200 --> 00:38:48,680
Unresponsive at scene.
Vitals unstable.

662
00:38:48,840 --> 00:38:50,160
Andy, you're on
airway breathing

663
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:51,480
Elly, you take circulation.

664
00:38:51,640 --> 00:38:53,960
And call the CT scanner
and tell him we'll be down soon.

665
00:38:54,120 --> 00:38:56,440
We started two 16-gauge IVs
with saline,

666
00:38:56,560 --> 00:38:57,880
but we were unable
to intubate him

667
00:38:58,000 --> 00:38:59,640
in the field due
to his unstable neck.

668
00:39:01,680 --> 00:39:04,360
Right. Transferring on three.
One, two, three.

669
00:39:14,240 --> 00:39:17,640
He arrived 30 minutes ago. The
best doctors are working on him.

670
00:39:23,040 --> 00:39:24,320
This way.

671
00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:34,320
Just through here.

672
00:39:39,320 --> 00:39:41,520
Here. Let me take your bag.

673
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:13,400
But surely... If he's breathing?

674
00:40:13,560 --> 00:40:16,600
Mrs Oliver, these machines
can keep his body alive,

675
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:19,280
but his spirit's
already left us.

676
00:40:26,040 --> 00:40:28,000
(Sobs)

677
00:40:45,400 --> 00:40:46,880
Oh!

678
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:50,080
Oh, such a brave boy
you are, Damien.

679
00:40:51,600 --> 00:40:53,520
Such brave boys.

680
00:41:12,360 --> 00:41:14,280
So, Doctor,
what's that in English?

681
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:27,960
Can we just pull
over here, mate?

682
00:41:32,840 --> 00:41:34,640
You right?

683
00:41:34,760 --> 00:41:37,800
Yeah, I'm OK.
I just need a second.

684
00:41:51,600 --> 00:41:53,520
(Sobs)

685
00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:05,600
REPORTER: Damien!

686
00:42:05,720 --> 00:42:07,560
OFFICER: Excuse us. Thank you.

REPORTERS:
How's your brother doing?

688
00:42:10,200 --> 00:42:11,600
Will he be able to ride again?

689
00:42:18,640 --> 00:42:19,560
Oh, Dame.

690
00:42:19,680 --> 00:42:22,840
Mum, come here, come here,
come here. It's OK.

691
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:25,280
It's OK, alright?

692
00:42:25,440 --> 00:42:28,280
They're doing everything
they can. Alright?

693
00:42:28,440 --> 00:42:30,800
They're pretty clever
these days.

694
00:42:34,360 --> 00:42:38,240
(Cardiac monitor beeps,
ventilator pumps)

TV ANCHOR: Today's accident
must be devastating

696
00:42:44,920 --> 00:42:46,920
for Pat Oliver, Damien's mother.

697
00:42:47,080 --> 00:42:48,120
Her husband, Ray,

698
00:42:48,280 --> 00:42:50,200
one of Western Australia's
most popular jockeys,

699
00:42:50,360 --> 00:42:53,320
suffered an horrific fall
27 years ago.

700
00:42:53,480 --> 00:42:56,320
Rushed to hospital, Ray Oliver
never regained consciousness

701
00:42:56,480 --> 00:42:59,800
and died shortly after, leaving
Pat the widowed mother of Jason,

702
00:42:59,920 --> 00:43:00,840
then five,

703
00:43:00,960 --> 00:43:02,760
and three-year-old Damien.

704
00:43:02,920 --> 00:43:05,320
Today's events will undoubtedly
have a dramatic effect

705
00:43:05,480 --> 00:43:07,280
on next week's Melbourne Cup,

706
00:43:07,400 --> 00:43:10,200
where Damien Oliver has
been booked to ride Media Puzzle

707
00:43:10,320 --> 00:43:12,720
for Irish trainer Dermot Weld.

708
00:43:17,600 --> 00:43:19,400
It's hard to believe
it won't affect him.

709
00:43:19,560 --> 00:43:22,640
Oh, it will affect him.
There's a family history.

710
00:43:24,200 --> 00:43:26,080
It's all very sad.

711
00:43:28,360 --> 00:43:32,480
So, what are you going to do?
Cup's only seven days away.

712
00:43:33,440 --> 00:43:35,360
(Phone rings)

713
00:43:37,600 --> 00:43:39,480
Yes?

714
00:43:41,080 --> 00:43:42,960
OK, put him through.

715
00:43:44,560 --> 00:43:47,200
Yes.

716
00:43:47,360 --> 00:43:50,120
Well, you can tell your readers
that I've been waiting

717
00:43:50,320 --> 00:43:53,760
for the best part of a decade
for next Tuesday,

718
00:43:53,920 --> 00:43:55,440
but that right now

719
00:43:55,600 --> 00:43:59,000
that poor, grieving family
is my only priority.

720
00:44:01,320 --> 00:44:03,240
No, I have not.

721
00:44:04,200 --> 00:44:06,880
Damien Oliver has been
hand-picked for this ride

722
00:44:07,040 --> 00:44:10,600
and I have total
and absolute confidence in him.

723
00:44:15,640 --> 00:44:18,720
These procedures have been known
to work in some cases.

724
00:44:20,520 --> 00:44:23,760
However, with the failure
of the third attempt,

725
00:44:23,920 --> 00:44:26,440
I'm terribly sorry, but we have
to accept the inevitable.

726
00:44:31,040 --> 00:44:33,400
Would it be alright if they had
some time alone with him?

727
00:44:33,520 --> 00:44:35,440
Yes, of course. Nurse?

728
00:44:40,080 --> 00:44:41,920
Thanks, mate.

729
00:44:42,080 --> 00:44:43,720
I'll be outside.

730
00:44:47,440 --> 00:44:50,840
(Sobs) Jason.

731
00:45:11,520 --> 00:45:13,720
They wouldn't let me in.
It's crazy.

732
00:45:13,880 --> 00:45:15,800
I've been out of town for work.
How is he?

733
00:45:21,920 --> 00:45:23,520
You want to come with me.

734
00:45:29,200 --> 00:45:31,000
I don't know
how to tell you this...

735
00:45:38,880 --> 00:45:40,840
(Sobs)

736
00:45:47,560 --> 00:45:51,120
(Weeps) No...

737
00:45:57,200 --> 00:45:59,120
DAMIEN: Jase?

738
00:46:01,240 --> 00:46:04,120
I don't know how much of this
you're going to get...

739
00:46:06,800 --> 00:46:09,440
but I couldn't have wished
for a better brother.

740
00:46:14,240 --> 00:46:17,480
And I forgive you for smashing
my nose with that cricket ball

741
00:46:17,640 --> 00:46:19,080
when we were little.

742
00:46:20,240 --> 00:46:22,840
I'm sorry for all the dirty
tricks I played on you.

743
00:46:26,240 --> 00:46:29,640
I even forgive you
for laughing your head off

744
00:46:29,800 --> 00:46:31,840
when I fell
in my first Melbourne Cup

745
00:46:34,200 --> 00:46:36,080
Took a few years, but...

746
00:46:38,680 --> 00:46:42,120
now even I can see
the funny side.

747
00:46:45,560 --> 00:46:48,440
Don't worry about Mum and Nan.

748
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:52,080
And I'll see that Jenny's OK.

749
00:46:55,640 --> 00:46:58,960
Just make sure
you do the right thing up there.

750
00:47:00,560 --> 00:47:04,480
And remember that you'll be
riding with me always.

751
00:47:15,600 --> 00:47:19,680
PAT: I thought about not
letting them race.

752
00:47:19,840 --> 00:47:21,800
But as I watched them grow up,

753
00:47:21,960 --> 00:47:24,680
all they wanted to do
was be like you.

754
00:47:27,600 --> 00:47:29,960
How could anyone stop two boys

755
00:47:30,120 --> 00:47:33,120
so determined to be
like their father?

756
00:47:38,200 --> 00:47:41,320
Now, I have no-one left
to turn to.

757
00:47:44,760 --> 00:47:46,680
Oh!

758
00:47:48,640 --> 00:47:50,600
I'm about to lose our Jason.

759
00:47:51,920 --> 00:47:54,360
And you're the only one
that can help.

760
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:59,440
(Cardiac monitor beeps)

761
00:48:00,280 --> 00:48:02,200
PAT: I raised him on my own.

762
00:48:04,640 --> 00:48:06,400
Now it's your turn, Ray...

763
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:10,520
(Beeping changes pitch)

764
00:48:10,680 --> 00:48:12,600
to love him...

765
00:48:17,680 --> 00:48:20,560
and to look after him.

766
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:25,920
(Beeping changes pitch)

767
00:48:26,880 --> 00:48:28,080
(Pat weeps)

768
00:48:50,760 --> 00:48:52,680
Ladies and gentlemen...

769
00:48:54,440 --> 00:48:57,720
Jason Oliver has
passed away peacefully tonight.

770
00:48:57,880 --> 00:49:00,680
His mother, Pat, and brother,
Damien, would like to thank

771
00:49:00,840 --> 00:49:03,320
the people of Australia
for their prayers

772
00:49:03,480 --> 00:49:06,080
and kind wishes
at this terrible time.

773
00:49:07,160 --> 00:49:08,960
As you can imagine,

774
00:49:09,120 --> 00:49:13,560
Jason's death is a tragic loss
to the family.

775
00:49:16,240 --> 00:49:19,840
Now, I know you've all got
a job to do,

776
00:49:19,960 --> 00:49:21,920
but right now Damien
has made no decision

777
00:49:22,080 --> 00:49:24,400
regarding next week's Cup.

778
00:49:24,560 --> 00:49:27,120
His family
is his highest priority.

779
00:49:27,280 --> 00:49:31,120
So, I would ask of you -
all of you...

780
00:49:33,640 --> 00:49:35,560
please respect their privacy.

781
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:39,920
Thank you very much.

782
00:49:48,840 --> 00:49:51,440
- Dermot, a few questions?
- Any decision on Damien Oliver?

783
00:49:51,600 --> 00:49:53,240
Yeah, what's happening
with Damien?

784
00:49:53,400 --> 00:49:56,120
Gentlemen, as you know, I've
been in the air almost a day,

785
00:49:56,280 --> 00:49:58,400
so I'll be of no value
until I talk with my team, OK?

786
00:49:58,560 --> 00:50:00,160
Is it true the ride's off?

787
00:50:00,320 --> 00:50:02,880
You're saying you have no idea
if Damien will ride in the Cup?

788
00:50:03,040 --> 00:50:05,680
Covey! Hello again. How are you?
Looking as fit as ever.

789
00:50:05,760 --> 00:50:07,120
Oh, thanks, Dermot.

790
00:50:07,280 --> 00:50:08,640
Can I ask if you're going
to change

791
00:50:08,800 --> 00:50:10,200
Media Puzzle's tactics
for the Cup?

792
00:50:10,360 --> 00:50:12,280
Your race plan worked
brilliantly at Geelong.

793
00:50:12,440 --> 00:50:14,520
- Mmmm.
- But the Cup's a longer race.

794
00:50:14,680 --> 00:50:17,360
Covey, if I was to tell you how
I was going to beat the field,

795
00:50:17,520 --> 00:50:19,080
they'd use it against me,
wouldn't they?

796
00:50:19,240 --> 00:50:20,880
Dermot, some of the other
jockeys you are considering?

797
00:50:21,040 --> 00:50:22,280
There are none.

798
00:50:22,440 --> 00:50:24,720
Come on. Dermot Weld
always has a backup plan.

799
00:50:24,880 --> 00:50:26,240
When will you speak to Damien?

800
00:50:26,360 --> 00:50:27,680
Let's get one thing straight.

801
00:50:27,840 --> 00:50:29,320
We're talking about
a grieving family,

802
00:50:29,480 --> 00:50:31,280
one that has suffered
a tragic loss.

803
00:50:31,440 --> 00:50:33,360
The Melbourne Cup -
it's only a horserace.

804
00:50:33,520 --> 00:50:35,000
(Chuckles) Crafty dog.

805
00:50:35,160 --> 00:50:36,800
Damien Oliver will remain
<i>as</i> our jockey

806
00:50:36,960 --> 00:50:38,440
until he notifies us otherwise.

807
00:50:38,600 --> 00:50:42,200
- And pigs might ﬂy.
- But the decision is Damien's.

808
00:50:42,280 --> 00:50:45,040
And no matter what choice
he makes,

809
00:50:45,240 --> 00:50:46,760
everyone in my organisation

810
00:50:46,920 --> 00:50:51,000
stands behind him, and supports
him and his family 100%.

811
00:50:51,160 --> 00:50:53,080
OK, thanks.

812
00:50:56,560 --> 00:50:57,920
He's right.

813
00:50:58,080 --> 00:51:00,640
Melbourne Cups
don't mean a thing.

814
00:51:03,160 --> 00:51:05,520
I'd give it all away
just to have Jase back.

815
00:51:18,480 --> 00:51:22,640
Dame, you know I'd never ask you
to give it up.

816
00:51:23,640 --> 00:51:25,560
I know what it means.

817
00:51:26,640 --> 00:51:29,600
And despite everything that
this family's gone through,

818
00:51:29,760 --> 00:51:32,400
I'd never ask that.

819
00:51:32,560 --> 00:51:34,480
I would.

820
00:51:37,320 --> 00:51:42,360
I wouldn't ask, actually -
I'd demand. It's gotta stop.

821
00:51:44,280 --> 00:51:47,600
When will it be time to pull the
plug? When they're all gone?

822
00:51:48,600 --> 00:51:51,920
Come on, Jen.
This is what we do.

823
00:51:52,080 --> 00:51:54,400
What you do is compete

824
00:51:54,560 --> 00:51:56,760
in the most dangerous sport
in the world,

825
00:51:56,920 --> 00:51:58,240
and it's killing you.

826
00:51:58,400 --> 00:52:03,240
Yeah, we know it's dangerous.
That's part of it.

827
00:52:04,360 --> 00:52:06,160
Look, I'm sure it's terrific fun

828
00:52:06,320 --> 00:52:09,240
hanging onto half a tonne
of wound-up horseflesh.

829
00:52:09,360 --> 00:52:13,600
The cheering crowds,
the huge buzz when you win.

830
00:52:13,760 --> 00:52:15,680
Who worries about the risks?

831
00:52:17,640 --> 00:52:19,440
Yeah, there's a bit of that.

832
00:52:19,600 --> 00:52:22,880
Your dad. Now Jason.

833
00:52:23,040 --> 00:52:25,800
When is it going
to be your turn?

834
00:52:30,720 --> 00:52:33,760
You know, every time Jason
raced, I was a mess.

835
00:52:34,760 --> 00:52:36,200
It will be even worse for you

836
00:52:36,360 --> 00:52:37,960
now that Damien's
the only one left.

837
00:52:40,160 --> 00:52:43,960
When is it going to be Trish's
turn to play the stoic widow?

838
00:52:48,280 --> 00:52:52,360
What's wrong with you?
Don't you even care?

839
00:52:56,480 --> 00:52:58,560
His track work's much better.

840
00:52:58,720 --> 00:53:01,320
Hasn't touched
his feed today, though.

841
00:53:01,480 --> 00:53:06,200
Didn't fancy your muesli this
morning, Vinnie? Let's see.

842
00:53:08,600 --> 00:53:12,280
Well. I'm not surprised.

843
00:53:15,080 --> 00:53:18,560
Presentation. (Sniffs) Mmm!

844
00:53:20,240 --> 00:53:22,160
Much nicer.

845
00:53:24,480 --> 00:53:26,400
Out.

846
00:53:30,880 --> 00:53:32,680
Bingo.

847
00:53:32,880 --> 00:53:34,800
(Mobile rings)

848
00:53:35,960 --> 00:53:37,440
Damien.

849
00:53:37,600 --> 00:53:41,240
Listen, how are you?
I'm terribly sorry.

850
00:53:43,240 --> 00:53:46,120
Thanks for giving us a call.
We thought we might've lost you.

851
00:53:46,280 --> 00:53:48,200
I'm not so sure you haven't.

852
00:53:50,360 --> 00:53:53,520
Look, I'll be back in Melbourne
tonight. Got a lot to sort out.

853
00:53:53,680 --> 00:53:56,240
Could you give me
some more time?

854
00:53:56,400 --> 00:53:58,480
As much as you need.

855
00:53:58,640 --> 00:54:01,320
That's great. Thanks.

856
00:54:02,440 --> 00:54:04,160
Listen, this is your call, OK?

857
00:54:04,320 --> 00:54:06,800
I'm not going to hold you
to anything.

858
00:54:09,560 --> 00:54:13,320
Big maniac of a horse
will miss you. We all will.

859
00:54:14,320 --> 00:54:16,160
You've got something
very special, Damien.

860
00:54:16,320 --> 00:54:19,040
But your heart has got
to be in it, you know?

861
00:54:19,200 --> 00:54:21,360
So, like I say, it's your call.

862
00:54:29,960 --> 00:54:32,960
You only need to look at Pugin
to realise why Frankie Dettori

863
00:54:33,120 --> 00:54:35,240
is regarded as one of the
world's greatest jockeys.

864
00:54:35,360 --> 00:54:37,880
Dettori, who only arrived
in Melbourne yesterday,

865
00:54:38,040 --> 00:54:40,160
is best remembered
for that magnificent seven...

866
00:54:40,360 --> 00:54:42,160
that glorious afternoon
at Royal Ascot

867
00:54:42,320 --> 00:54:44,800
when he won every race
on the card.

868
00:54:44,960 --> 00:54:48,160
Tony Jones. National Nine News.

869
00:54:59,520 --> 00:55:01,640
It's like some family curse.

870
00:55:03,440 --> 00:55:05,960
First Dad, now Jase.

871
00:55:06,120 --> 00:55:08,240
I know you don't believe that.

872
00:55:09,600 --> 00:55:11,400
What would happen to you
if I went as well?

873
00:55:11,560 --> 00:55:14,840
- Damien!
- I could. Easy.

874
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:17,080
And they say stuff happens
in threes.

875
00:55:17,240 --> 00:55:19,320
Yeah? Well, I'm prepared
to take my chances.

876
00:55:19,480 --> 00:55:21,440
Yeah, well, maybe Jenny's right.

877
00:55:23,200 --> 00:55:28,040
Why don't I just chuck it in
while I'm still in one piece?

878
00:55:31,200 --> 00:55:33,200
At least then
I wouldn't have to...

879
00:55:33,320 --> 00:55:36,560
get up at 4 am
every bloody day.

880
00:55:36,720 --> 00:55:39,720
Starve myself half to death
every bloody day.

881
00:55:39,880 --> 00:55:43,560
Work my guts out every day.
For what?

882
00:55:46,040 --> 00:55:49,280
For a start,
it's in your blood.

883
00:55:51,120 --> 00:55:53,640
You also happen to be
one of the best.

884
00:55:54,600 --> 00:55:57,680
I don't think you'd forgive
yourself if you didn't ride.

885
00:55:59,080 --> 00:56:01,000
I'm not so sure.

886
00:56:01,960 --> 00:56:04,000
If the spark's gone,
what's the point?

887
00:56:05,880 --> 00:56:09,000
Maybe the spark's
just dimmed a little.

888
00:56:09,960 --> 00:56:13,200
It would be amazing
if it hasn't.

889
00:56:15,160 --> 00:56:18,480
I've seen blokes
on top of their game.

890
00:56:19,440 --> 00:56:22,720
Everything's a breeze -
they can't do anything wrong.

891
00:56:22,880 --> 00:56:24,040
Amazing moves.

892
00:56:24,200 --> 00:56:28,000
Right on the money every time,
no matter what.

893
00:56:28,160 --> 00:56:30,120
It's like they're blessed.

894
00:56:34,160 --> 00:56:37,520
And then, for some reason,
they just lose it.

895
00:56:39,720 --> 00:56:41,480
No matter how hard they try...

896
00:56:41,640 --> 00:56:44,720
or maybe because
they try too hard...

897
00:56:44,920 --> 00:56:46,840
they never get it back.

898
00:56:49,400 --> 00:56:51,360
Never ever.

899
00:56:54,040 --> 00:56:57,120
What if that's happened to me?

900
00:56:58,120 --> 00:56:59,440
If I've lost my confidence,

901
00:56:59,560 --> 00:57:01,680
I'll be a danger to myself
and everyone else.

902
00:57:03,160 --> 00:57:04,360
You haven't.

903
00:57:04,560 --> 00:57:07,040
You're not falling apart,
and your family's not cursed.

904
00:57:09,800 --> 00:57:12,000
What you have lost

905
00:57:12,160 --> 00:57:15,720
is your amazing best mate
of a brother.

906
00:57:18,960 --> 00:57:22,800
I can only imagine
how dreadful that must feel,

907
00:57:22,920 --> 00:57:25,520
but I know
you'll get through it.

908
00:57:29,160 --> 00:57:30,560
Maybe.

909
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:34,920
Take your time.

910
00:58:17,240 --> 00:58:19,040
Any word from Damien?

911
00:58:19,200 --> 00:58:21,120
Not yet.

912
00:58:32,600 --> 00:58:36,480
Five days.
Five days till the big day.

913
00:58:36,640 --> 00:58:38,720
And we've lost our jockey.

914
00:58:38,880 --> 00:58:40,200
Or perhaps worse,

915
00:58:40,360 --> 00:58:42,560
we're carrying one
who's so grief-stricken

916
00:58:42,720 --> 00:58:44,520
he doesn't know
whether he's coming or going.

917
00:58:44,720 --> 00:58:47,840
Damien has an amazing affinity
with this fellow.

918
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:49,640
Even if we got
a top replacement,

919
00:58:49,800 --> 00:58:52,120
I'm not sure
we'd be any better off.

920
00:58:52,280 --> 00:58:54,200
Hmm.

921
00:58:56,600 --> 00:59:00,880
Remember '93, Dave? Vintage
Crop, what we were up against?

922
00:59:01,040 --> 00:59:05,200
Well, we showed them then,
and we'll show them again.

923
00:59:06,720 --> 00:59:09,400
We've got two brave horses,
and they know it.

924
00:59:09,520 --> 00:59:12,000
When this race turns for home,
they'll be in the thick of it.

925
00:59:12,160 --> 00:59:14,080
I know that.

926
00:59:15,040 --> 00:59:17,000
I also know
this is one very special horse.

927
00:59:19,800 --> 00:59:21,600
The Irish Wizard.

928
00:59:21,720 --> 00:59:23,040
Ah, Saeed.

929
00:59:25,640 --> 00:59:27,520
- Good to see you.
- You too, my friend.

930
00:59:27,680 --> 00:59:30,440
Thanks. From what the boys tell
me, your trio's in fine form.

931
00:59:30,640 --> 00:59:32,800
Well, they should know.
How are yours?

932
00:59:32,920 --> 00:59:34,800
You're saying you don't know?
You tell me.

933
00:59:34,960 --> 00:59:39,120
What about Damien?
That's something we don't know.

934
00:59:39,280 --> 00:59:41,760
Nothing to worry yourself about.

935
00:59:56,440 --> 00:59:58,680
- Trish?
- Hi, Lee.

936
00:59:58,840 --> 01:00:00,960
- How are you?
- Yeah, I'm good.

937
01:00:01,080 --> 01:00:04,040
Glad you could make it.
Looking well.

938
01:00:04,200 --> 01:00:07,320
Yeah. That's what
a week away from riding can do.

939
01:00:07,480 --> 01:00:10,280
You know what they say about
getting back in the saddle.

940
01:00:10,400 --> 01:00:14,120
Hey, listen.
This is Trish's idea.

941
01:00:15,200 --> 01:00:18,920
I really don't know. I'm not
sure I can even get on a horse.

942
01:00:19,080 --> 01:00:21,640
No. We'll take this
one step at a time, OK?

943
01:00:21,800 --> 01:00:23,240
You sleep in tomorrow.

944
01:00:23,400 --> 01:00:25,240
Things will look a lot better
in the morning.

945
01:00:25,360 --> 01:00:28,280
We'll get you a good breakfast,
get you saddled up,

946
01:00:28,440 --> 01:00:30,880
then I'll teach you a thing
or two about riding a horse.

947
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:32,920
(Damien laughs)

948
01:00:46,880 --> 01:00:50,680
Hey. Hey. That's a boy.

949
01:01:01,560 --> 01:01:04,280
See, that didn't hurt, did it?

950
01:01:04,440 --> 01:01:08,160
Feels surprisingly good,
then this isn't Media Puzzle.

951
01:01:26,160 --> 01:01:27,920
So far so good.

952
01:01:28,040 --> 01:01:30,760
Looks <i>as</i> fit as a fiddle.

953
01:01:32,160 --> 01:01:34,560
No doubt about his ability.

954
01:01:39,720 --> 01:01:42,000
Looked good. How did it feel?

955
01:01:44,320 --> 01:01:47,280
Yeah, OK. I'm not really sure.

956
01:01:49,560 --> 01:01:53,800
It's not just the Cup. I've got
12 rides booked before then.

957
01:01:53,960 --> 01:01:55,400
I just can't stand the idea

958
01:01:55,560 --> 01:01:57,640
of going out there
not doing my best,

959
01:01:57,800 --> 01:02:00,280
and people still cheering me on
for the wrong reasons.

960
01:02:02,200 --> 01:02:05,280
Look, Dame, I just want you
to know I'm here for you.

961
01:02:05,440 --> 01:02:08,360
I love you, and I'll support
whatever you decide to do.

962
01:02:14,680 --> 01:02:16,600
What do you reckon, Pins?

963
01:02:18,080 --> 01:02:20,320
Ollie, you just have
to ask yourself,

964
01:02:20,480 --> 01:02:23,120
what would Jase want you to do?

965
01:03:12,240 --> 01:03:13,840
Hey, shh.

966
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:16,360
Hey. Hey...

967
01:03:17,560 --> 01:03:20,360
Come here, come here. Shh.

968
01:03:23,800 --> 01:03:25,720
What do you reckon, big fella?

969
01:03:28,480 --> 01:03:30,400
What, you think
I've given up on you?

970
01:03:31,720 --> 01:03:35,680
No way, mate. We'll show 'em.

971
01:03:35,840 --> 01:03:38,120
Jase wouldn't want us sitting
around on our arses sulking,

972
01:03:38,240 --> 01:03:39,480
that's for sure.

973
01:03:51,440 --> 01:03:52,760
Made your mind up?

974
01:03:52,920 --> 01:03:55,240
Yep.

975
01:03:55,400 --> 01:03:57,080
Haven't we?

976
01:03:58,120 --> 01:04:00,680
And Hydrometer
is joined by Davidoff.

977
01:04:00,840 --> 01:04:02,200
Damien Oliver going for

978
01:04:02,360 --> 01:04:03,600
two straight derbies,

979
01:04:03,760 --> 01:04:05,360
but there are
challengers galore.

980
01:04:05,520 --> 01:04:07,160
Here comes Diamond Jake
down the outside,

981
01:04:07,320 --> 01:04:08,720
and Helenus is coming on.

982
01:04:08,880 --> 01:04:11,560
Go, Ollie!

983
01:04:12,560 --> 01:04:15,560
Down 150m to go.
Hydrometer kicking well.

984
01:04:15,680 --> 01:04:17,080
Helenus is coming after him.

985
01:04:17,240 --> 01:04:19,280
Ain't Here is joining in.
And Davidoff...

986
01:04:19,400 --> 01:04:21,200
- Come on, Damien!
(Crowd cheering)

987
01:04:21,360 --> 01:04:24,480
Helenus coming at him. Helenus,
Hydrometer, they hit the line.

988
01:04:24,680 --> 01:04:27,040
Photo finish.
Helenus or Hydrometer.

989
01:04:27,200 --> 01:04:28,680
Ain't Here has run third.

990
01:04:28,840 --> 01:04:30,720
And then Maskerado,
Diamond Jake, Davidoff.

991
01:04:30,880 --> 01:04:33,440
Damien gave him every chance,
but he weakens out late.

992
01:04:35,240 --> 01:04:37,200
Rubitano has the flat side
well beaten.

993
01:04:37,360 --> 01:04:38,800
Oh, he's in front overall.

994
01:04:38,960 --> 01:04:41,360
And it's the Newmarket winner,
Rubitano, who scores,

995
01:04:41,560 --> 01:04:44,240
Intelligent Star second,
Cosmic Strike third.

996
01:04:44,400 --> 01:04:47,120
Damien Oliver on Chong Tong -
never a hope.

997
01:04:47,280 --> 01:04:50,120
Do you think
he made the right decision?

998
01:04:50,240 --> 01:04:52,160
By the grace of God.

999
01:04:58,440 --> 01:05:01,160
- Good one, mate.
- Good on you, mate.

1000
01:05:01,320 --> 01:05:03,120
CALLER: And he soon after
took the lead.

1001
01:05:03,280 --> 01:05:05,120
Lord Volksraad has a real fight
on his hands.

1002
01:05:05,240 --> 01:05:07,640
Delago Brom coming home
the better on the outside.

1003
01:05:07,800 --> 01:05:10,040
And it's Delago Brom
who beats Lord Volksraad.

1004
01:05:10,200 --> 01:05:11,480
Charlie Bub third.

1005
01:05:11,640 --> 01:05:15,520
And Ollie on True Glo, back at
the tail. It's just not his day.

1006
01:05:17,920 --> 01:05:19,720
Excuse me.

1007
01:05:21,960 --> 01:05:23,840
That's seven losses
on seven top horses.

1008
01:05:23,960 --> 01:05:25,680
He couldn't even get a place.

1009
01:05:25,800 --> 01:05:27,560
DERMOT: All very true.

1010
01:05:27,680 --> 01:05:30,240
SMURFIT: Surely enough's enough.
We have to replace him.

1011
01:05:31,200 --> 01:05:33,800
Not necessarily.
He's actually riding very well.

1012
01:05:33,920 --> 01:05:35,880
SMURFIT: All I know
is he's not winning.

1013
01:05:36,840 --> 01:05:38,720
I put a lot of money
into this venture already.

1014
01:05:38,880 --> 01:05:40,640
I'm the owner and I say he goes.

1015
01:05:40,760 --> 01:05:43,040
Well, I'm the trainer
and I say he stays.

1016
01:05:43,200 --> 01:05:45,120
The man and the horse
are champions.

1017
01:05:45,280 --> 01:05:47,080
That has to add up to something.

1018
01:05:47,240 --> 01:05:48,760
Both with huge problems.

1019
01:05:48,960 --> 01:05:51,080
We don't know if the horse
will go the distance.

1020
01:05:51,240 --> 01:05:52,640
The jockey's paralyzed
with grief.

1021
01:05:52,800 --> 01:05:54,760
DERMOT: He's still
our best option.

1022
01:05:54,880 --> 01:05:58,240
SMURFIT: Dermot, I've always
backed your decisions.

1023
01:05:58,400 --> 01:06:00,640
Are you sure
we shouldn't reconsider?

1024
01:06:00,800 --> 01:06:03,960
Yes, I am. Don't forget Geelong.

1025
01:06:04,120 --> 01:06:05,920
He's not the same man
who won at Geelong.

1026
01:06:06,040 --> 01:06:09,240
I believe he's the only man
to ride that horse in the Cup.

1027
01:06:09,400 --> 01:06:11,560
And if it means risking
the copious amounts of money

1028
01:06:11,680 --> 01:06:14,360
you've given me to prove it,
I'm prepared to do that.

1029
01:06:36,400 --> 01:06:39,520
LEE: Whole day was one big blur,
wasn't it?

1030
01:06:42,680 --> 01:06:44,800
I've had better.

1031
01:06:53,960 --> 01:06:55,720
Nice to win the ones
he hasn't won. You know?

1032
01:06:55,880 --> 01:06:57,720
(Reporters chuckle)
- There's not many, you know?

1033
01:06:57,880 --> 01:07:00,320
I mean, nothing compares with
the Melbourne Cup, you know?

1034
01:07:00,480 --> 01:07:02,760
It's a breed of horse race
that has no equal,

1035
01:07:02,880 --> 01:07:05,120
which is why, of course,
it attracts the very best.

1036
01:07:05,280 --> 01:07:07,240
Australia has more race
courses than Ireland, England,

1037
01:07:07,400 --> 01:07:10,280
United States and Canada
combined, you know?

1038
01:07:10,440 --> 01:07:11,680
I mean, that's a fact.

1039
01:07:11,840 --> 01:07:13,680
It makes it pretty special,
doesn't it? Thanks.

1040
01:07:13,840 --> 01:07:15,800
Hello, Bart.

1041
01:07:15,960 --> 01:07:18,440
Ladies and gentlemen, would you
take your seats, please?

1042
01:07:18,600 --> 01:07:20,960
- We all here?
- Everyone except Damien.

1043
01:07:22,040 --> 01:07:23,600
Well, he's entitled to run late.

1044
01:07:23,720 --> 01:07:25,920
Seven rides is a big day
for anyone.

1045
01:07:27,760 --> 01:07:30,040
And in case you don't know it,
they were damn fine rides.

1046
01:07:30,200 --> 01:07:31,400
Just wasn't his day.

1047
01:07:31,560 --> 01:07:32,960
Ladies and gentlemen,
good evening,

1048
01:07:33,080 --> 01:07:34,840
and welcome to the barrier draw

1049
01:07:34,960 --> 01:07:38,120
for the running
of the 2002 Melbourne Cup.

1050
01:07:38,280 --> 01:07:40,440
And the first to draw tonight

1051
01:07:40,560 --> 01:07:43,080
is the trainer of the top weight
in Vinnie Roe...

1052
01:07:43,240 --> 01:07:45,160
Mr Dermot Weld.

1053
01:07:55,800 --> 01:07:59,440
The luck of the Irish, as Vinnie
Roe comes out at barrier No.7.

1054
01:08:00,760 --> 01:08:02,880
- Good one, mate.
- That's great.

1055
01:08:03,840 --> 01:08:06,200
And now it's time
for the Cups king himself...

1056
01:08:06,360 --> 01:08:09,080
11-time Melbourne Cup-winning
trainer Bart Cummings,

1057
01:08:09,240 --> 01:08:11,040
who'll do the honours
for Miss Melise.

1058
01:08:11,200 --> 01:08:13,120
(Applause)

1059
01:08:21,800 --> 01:08:24,120
Oh, I know that look.
I've seen that before.

1060
01:08:24,280 --> 01:08:26,680
Not on you, though.
On your brother.

1061
01:08:26,840 --> 01:08:29,080
The day I had to let him go.

1062
01:08:30,920 --> 01:08:33,680
So, anyway, I'm sacking Jason,
I'm sending him back to Perth,

1063
01:08:33,840 --> 01:08:35,240
and you know what he does?

1064
01:08:35,400 --> 01:08:40,560
He's a cheeky bugger.
He asks me for a favour.

1065
01:08:40,720 --> 01:08:44,240
Now, most guys will ask
for a bit of extra pocket money

1066
01:08:44,400 --> 01:08:48,760
or others will beg for a second
chance but not Jason.

1067
01:08:48,880 --> 01:08:53,160
He tells me about his younger
brother, just starting out.

1068
01:08:53,320 --> 01:08:58,160
You couldn't have been 16,
but even then Jason knew

1069
01:08:58,280 --> 01:09:01,040
that you were going to be
a better jockey than him...

1070
01:09:01,200 --> 01:09:03,400
or your father
or your grandfather...

1071
01:09:03,560 --> 01:09:05,800
better than they
ever dreamed of being.

1072
01:09:05,960 --> 01:09:07,760
You know what he told me?

1073
01:09:07,920 --> 01:09:11,360
He said, 'One day,
my brother will be a champion.'

1074
01:09:12,520 --> 01:09:14,600
Well, that day, my friend,
was today.

1075
01:09:16,600 --> 01:09:18,480
- Lee...
- Don't take my word for it.

1076
01:09:18,640 --> 01:09:20,560
You ask anybody
in these stands today.

1077
01:09:20,720 --> 01:09:22,760
And I'll tell you,
as one horseman to another,

1078
01:09:22,920 --> 01:09:27,120
that sometimes being a champion
isn't about winning.

1079
01:09:27,280 --> 01:09:31,360
It's about gutsing it out.
It's about what you did today.

1080
01:09:35,480 --> 01:09:37,480
Saeed bin Suroor
will now choose

1081
01:09:37,600 --> 01:09:40,200
for the Godolphin's
third entry, Pugin.

1082
01:09:40,360 --> 01:09:42,240
(Applause)

1083
01:09:44,800 --> 01:09:47,120
- Better choose me a good one!
(Laughter)

1084
01:09:47,280 --> 01:09:49,640
Need I mention it, that Frankie
Dettori is riding Pugin.

1085
01:09:49,760 --> 01:09:51,600
(Laughter)

1086
01:09:51,720 --> 01:09:54,680
Not this one. No.
Not this one. That's...

1087
01:09:54,840 --> 01:09:56,680
No. One. That's the one.

1088
01:09:56,840 --> 01:09:58,360
- That's the one.
(Laughter)

1089
01:10:00,480 --> 01:10:03,120
And Pugin will start
from barrier 15.

1090
01:10:03,280 --> 01:10:05,200
(Applause)

1091
01:10:06,920 --> 01:10:08,840
Thank you. Thank you.

1092
01:10:11,040 --> 01:10:13,800
Well, who will do the honours
for Media Puzzle, Mr Weld?

1093
01:10:14,760 --> 01:10:17,080
Your turn.

1094
01:10:17,240 --> 01:10:19,080
Don't do this to me.

1095
01:10:19,240 --> 01:10:21,080
Pick him a nice one.

1096
01:10:21,240 --> 01:10:23,920
You pay me to look after your
horses, not choose their gates.

1097
01:10:25,440 --> 01:10:27,360
David, today you'll do both.

1098
01:10:29,720 --> 01:10:31,000
Excuse me.

1099
01:10:31,160 --> 01:10:33,400
It looks like travelling foreman
for the Weld stable,

1100
01:10:33,560 --> 01:10:35,640
Dave Phillips, has that honour.

1101
01:10:35,800 --> 01:10:37,440
(Applause)

1102
01:10:42,600 --> 01:10:45,400
And Media Puzzle has drawn
barrier 3.

1103
01:10:45,560 --> 01:10:47,480
(Audience murmurs)

1104
01:10:50,360 --> 01:10:51,480
So I tell him...

1105
01:10:51,640 --> 01:10:54,400
I say, 'You know, you'd better
get me a good one or else.'

1106
01:10:54,560 --> 01:10:57,640
And look at it.
But you never cross an Italian.

1107
01:10:57,800 --> 01:11:00,960
I mean, even the small ones
like me. (Laughs)

1108
01:11:01,120 --> 01:11:03,440
People say that closer to
the rails is better, but...

1109
01:11:03,600 --> 01:11:05,000
I mean, you know this track.

1110
01:11:05,160 --> 01:11:06,880
It's 1.000 m straight
from the gate.

1111
01:11:07,040 --> 01:11:08,880
So, starting at 23, 24,
you know,

1112
01:11:09,040 --> 01:11:10,840
it's not the end of the world.

1113
01:11:11,000 --> 01:11:13,720
That's what they say, though
I know where I'd rather be.

1114
01:11:13,880 --> 01:11:15,080
(Chuckles)

1115
01:11:21,680 --> 01:11:24,560
You did good, mate.
Much obliged.

1116
01:11:28,160 --> 01:11:30,080
Damien, I don't know how to...

1117
01:11:32,080 --> 01:11:37,320
Last year, Niall and I,
well, our sister died.

1118
01:11:38,240 --> 01:11:42,280
No warning. Never sick.
Just gone.

1119
01:11:43,480 --> 01:11:47,000
What that's done to our family,
maybe you can understand.

1120
01:11:48,520 --> 01:11:51,800
So, when Dermot told me we were
coming back to Australia,

1121
01:11:51,960 --> 01:11:55,640
I decided to devote
all my efforts, all my energies,

1122
01:11:55,800 --> 01:11:58,640
to winning the Cup for Veronica.

1123
01:11:58,800 --> 01:12:01,560
If you like,
to honour her memory.

1124
01:12:02,520 --> 01:12:04,000
That good gate I got you

1125
01:12:04,160 --> 01:12:06,400
wasn't just the luck
of the draw, you know?

1126
01:12:06,560 --> 01:12:12,520
Someone I love dearly helped me
to do what I couldn't do myself,

1127
01:12:12,680 --> 01:12:15,960
which is why, on Tuesday,
when you race for the Cup,

1128
01:12:16,120 --> 01:12:18,840
I don't believe
you'll be riding alone.

1129
01:12:25,080 --> 01:12:27,520
You two have been making
race plans without me again?

1130
01:12:27,680 --> 01:12:29,600
It worked at Geelong.

1131
01:12:30,680 --> 01:12:32,480
Are you OK?

1132
01:12:32,640 --> 01:12:34,560
Yeah.

1133
01:12:35,520 --> 01:12:37,440
You've been to Ireland, Damien.

1134
01:12:38,480 --> 01:12:40,400
You know, the rare sunny day
always punctures

1135
01:12:40,560 --> 01:12:42,560
a long stretch of damp
and darkness.

1136
01:12:42,720 --> 01:12:43,960
I know, on Tuesday,

1137
01:12:44,120 --> 01:12:46,160
you're the one who can get
the most out of my horse.

1138
01:12:47,600 --> 01:12:49,600
I've seen how he responds
to you.

1139
01:12:50,840 --> 01:12:53,880
Between the two of you,
you can do it.

1140
01:12:55,160 --> 01:12:56,960
Thanks, Dermot.

1141
01:12:57,120 --> 01:12:58,920
Welcome back to
The Coodabeen Champions.

1142
01:12:59,080 --> 01:13:00,320
This Cup eve edition,

1143
01:13:00,480 --> 01:13:02,160
we start to put together
this jigsaw puzzle

1144
01:13:02,320 --> 01:13:03,680
that is this year's
Melbourne Cup.

1145
01:13:03,840 --> 01:13:06,160
It's interesting you talk
puzzle, Richo, because

1146
01:13:06,320 --> 01:13:08,360
I have not deviated
from backing Media Puzzle.

1147
01:13:08,520 --> 01:13:10,840
I've supported it right through.
Saw it win at Geelong.

1148
01:13:11,000 --> 01:13:13,240
- Spoke to Damien afterwards.
- What did he say?

1149
01:13:13,400 --> 01:13:15,160
- Can't tell you that.
- Then, why tell us?

1150
01:13:15,320 --> 01:13:17,480
- Well, I can't.
- Should've spoken to Dermot.

1151
01:13:17,640 --> 01:13:18,920
Well, I've spoken to him too.

1152
01:13:19,080 --> 01:13:20,680
I went out to the airport,
saw him on arrival.

1153
01:13:20,840 --> 01:13:23,320
- Me and Dermot are like that.
- Well, what did he say?

1154
01:13:23,480 --> 01:13:25,480
'Can you take my bags
up to room 732, laddie?'

1155
01:13:25,640 --> 01:13:27,440
Whatever he told you,
he'd do the opposite.

1156
01:13:27,600 --> 01:13:29,800
For goodness sake, spit it out.
What did he tell you?

1157
01:13:29,960 --> 01:13:31,760
- Well, I can't tell you.
BOTH: Why not?

1158
01:13:31,920 --> 01:13:33,800
Because the laws of libel
prevent me.

1159
01:13:33,960 --> 01:13:34,920
ALL: Oh.

1160
01:13:39,680 --> 01:13:41,480
Not surprised to find you here.

1161
01:13:41,640 --> 01:13:43,440
Nor you.

1162
01:13:45,320 --> 01:13:47,240
It's never easy.

1163
01:13:49,680 --> 01:13:51,880
I'll never forget
the first time.

1164
01:13:52,040 --> 01:13:54,960
- '93?
- Yeah.

1165
01:13:55,120 --> 01:13:57,520
Real or imaginary problems?

1166
01:14:02,760 --> 01:14:04,680
All anyone remembers
is that we won.

1167
01:14:06,960 --> 01:14:08,760
They don't realise that anything

1168
01:14:08,920 --> 01:14:11,120
that could go wrong with
that horse did go wrong.

1169
01:14:11,280 --> 01:14:13,600
How wrong?

1170
01:14:13,760 --> 01:14:16,280
Vintage Crop
had an inflamed sacroiliac.

1171
01:14:16,440 --> 01:14:18,640
He won a two-miler
with a bad back?

1172
01:14:18,800 --> 01:14:21,880
And ulcers.
And he hadn't travelled well.

1173
01:14:22,040 --> 01:14:25,000
Getting him to the starting gate
was a victory in itself.

1174
01:14:25,160 --> 01:14:26,400
And still, after all that,

1175
01:14:26,560 --> 01:14:28,480
every time I come back
to race for the Cup,

1176
01:14:28,640 --> 01:14:30,440
they treat me like
I'm a cat burglar.

1177
01:14:30,600 --> 01:14:33,440
(Chuckles) I know what you mean.

1178
01:14:33,600 --> 01:14:35,000
Hmm.

1179
01:14:36,480 --> 01:14:41,840
Remember Phar Lap? Years ago?
One of the greatest.

1180
01:14:42,000 --> 01:14:43,560
Right up there with
Seabiscuit, Secretariat.

1181
01:14:43,640 --> 01:14:44,920
Didn't know how to lose.

1182
01:14:45,080 --> 01:14:46,880
Everybody knows about Phar Lap.

1183
01:14:47,040 --> 01:14:48,600
Yeah, but not the politics.

1184
01:14:49,800 --> 01:14:51,280
His owner
was a working-class trainer.

1185
01:14:51,440 --> 01:14:53,200
Wrong side of the tracks,
you know?

1186
01:14:53,360 --> 01:14:55,840
His other owner
was an American Jew.

1187
01:14:56,000 --> 01:14:57,720
In those days,
it was a little bit too much

1188
01:14:57,880 --> 01:14:59,440
for the old boys
who controlled racing,

1189
01:14:59,560 --> 01:15:02,400
so they weighed him down
so heavily, he couldn't win.

1190
01:15:03,960 --> 01:15:04,760
1931 Cup,

1191
01:15:04,920 --> 01:15:08,320
Phar Lap carried 15 kg more than
Vinnie's top weight tomorrow.

1192
01:15:09,360 --> 01:15:12,320
- Fifteen kilos?
- Yep.

1193
01:15:17,240 --> 01:15:19,960
I guess we're a little bit like
Phar Lap's connections, Saeed.

1194
01:15:22,640 --> 01:15:26,520
They want us here.
They want the prestige we bring.

1195
01:15:26,680 --> 01:15:28,880
But they definitely
don't want us to win.

1196
01:15:30,320 --> 01:15:33,560
It's more than just a prize
to them. It's who they are.

1197
01:15:35,680 --> 01:15:37,760
Come to these shores
to race for the Cup,

1198
01:15:37,880 --> 01:15:39,800
you're up against
more than 20 trainers.

1199
01:15:41,560 --> 01:15:43,840
You're up against
the whole of Australia.

1200
01:15:44,000 --> 01:15:45,600
(Door opens)

1201
01:15:48,440 --> 01:15:50,360
There's someone to see you.

1202
01:15:52,280 --> 01:15:56,280
Hey, g'day.
You're not lost, are you?

1203
01:15:56,440 --> 01:15:59,000
(Chuckles)
Nah. I just thought I'd drop in.

1204
01:15:59,160 --> 01:16:02,320
I'm a big fan,
even though you play for North.

1205
01:16:02,480 --> 01:16:04,800
You almost knocked us
out of the finals.

1206
01:16:04,960 --> 01:16:06,760
Yeah.

1207
01:16:06,920 --> 01:16:09,080
I was there at the game
with my brother.

1208
01:16:11,400 --> 01:16:14,200
Yeah, I heard about
the accident.

1209
01:16:14,360 --> 01:16:16,360
I'm really sorry, mate.

1210
01:16:17,800 --> 01:16:19,760
The only good thing
is it happened so fast,

1211
01:16:19,920 --> 01:16:21,360
he never knew what hit him.

1212
01:16:24,640 --> 01:16:27,840
But, hey, I'm here to see you.

1213
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:31,200
Mate, that Bali business -
you were amazing.

1214
01:16:31,320 --> 01:16:35,520
No. I didn't really have time
to think, you know?

1215
01:16:35,680 --> 01:16:40,600
Chaos all around.
Like a game of footy, really.

1216
01:16:40,800 --> 01:16:46,160
Yeah, but... Pulling people out?
Diving back in for more?

1217
01:16:46,280 --> 01:16:48,200
Anyone would have done the same.

1218
01:16:49,480 --> 01:16:51,400
I just knew I had to keep going.

1219

..but it's Toast of the Coast.

1249
01:18:59,760 --> 01:19:02,520
Oliver's kicked him forward from
an outside gate and has the lead

1250
01:19:02,680 --> 01:19:04,400
but Tarcoola Diamond's
coming at him...

1251
01:19:04,560 --> 01:19:06,360
Tight on Damien, and take 6.

1252
01:19:06,520 --> 01:19:08,320
CALLER: ..a length in front
of Toast Of The Coast,

1253
01:19:08,480 --> 01:19:09,320
who can't go on.

1254
01:19:09,440 --> 01:19:12,320
It's You is flashing home. But
it's Tarcoola Diamond who wins.

1255
01:19:12,520 --> 01:19:14,880
It's You got up for second.
Joy Of Flight third.

1256
01:19:15,040 --> 01:19:17,560
Ollie's Toast Of The Coast
dropped out late in the race.

1257
01:19:17,720 --> 01:19:19,600
And then Shot At The Title
and Pomme De Here.

1258
01:19:19,720 --> 01:19:22,720
Then followed by Light Of Day
and It's Fuji Beauty.

1259
01:19:24,680 --> 01:19:27,080
And Damien Oliver's
terrible run continues.

1260
01:19:27,200 --> 01:19:29,880
His fifth ride today,
finishing in fourth place.

1261
01:19:30,000 --> 01:19:32,160
In all 12 races
on well-fancied mounts

1262
01:19:32,320 --> 01:19:34,160
since his return on Derby Day,

1263
01:19:34,320 --> 01:19:36,960
Damien Oliver has finished
no better than fourth.

1264
01:19:37,120 --> 01:19:39,280
Unusually, he's spent
more time than normal for him

1265
01:19:39,400 --> 01:19:41,880
on rides towards the rear
of the field.

1266
01:19:42,040 --> 01:19:44,160
Our hearts go out
to this champion.

1267
01:19:46,160 --> 01:19:48,040
You realise
this is Damien's 13th ride

1268
01:19:48,200 --> 01:19:50,800
and believe it or not-
his 13th Melbourne Cup.

1269
01:19:50,960 --> 01:19:53,160
It makes you think, doesn't it?

1270
01:19:53,320 --> 01:19:56,080
I'd say anything would help.

1271
01:19:57,120 --> 01:19:59,320
Next up, the event
we've all been waiting for...

1272
01:19:59,480 --> 01:20:02,720
the running
of the 142nd Melbourne Cup.

1273
01:20:05,760 --> 01:20:08,800
So, we're there in Paris
and Marienbard is...

1274
01:20:08,960 --> 01:20:11,200
Oh, he's going really excellent.

1275
01:20:11,360 --> 01:20:15,160
The Arc is almost mine. But it's
still a long way to the finish.

1276
01:20:15,320 --> 01:20:17,920
And here comes Sulamani on the
outside. He finds another kick.

1277
01:20:18,120 --> 01:20:19,880
And I'm searching for the line,
you know?

1278
01:20:20,080 --> 01:20:22,760
"Where is the line? Where is
the line? Where is the line?"

1279
01:20:24,880 --> 01:20:26,800
And I... I tell you it later.

1280
01:20:35,000 --> 01:20:36,920
Bit of a rough one, eh, Ollie?

1281
01:20:38,320 --> 01:20:40,120
Yep.

1282
01:20:40,240 --> 01:20:41,760
Anyway, glad you made it.

1283
01:20:41,920 --> 01:20:44,160
It wouldn't be the same
without you.

1284
01:20:45,080 --> 01:20:47,000
Cheers, Macca.

1285
01:20:50,480 --> 01:20:53,360
FRANKIE: Come on.
I show you the way home, huh?

1286
01:21:19,400 --> 01:21:20,520
Riders, please.

1287
01:21:26,800 --> 01:21:30,960
Gentlemen, I don't need to tell
you that this is a big race.

1288
01:21:31,160 --> 01:21:35,560
The stakes are high.
Prize money of $4 million.

1289
01:21:36,600 --> 01:21:39,800
But that doesn't mean
that the usual rules don't apply

1290
01:21:39,960 --> 01:21:41,960
and you can get away
with anything silly.

1291
01:21:42,120 --> 01:21:44,880
There will be no leniency
for careless riding.

1292
01:21:45,040 --> 01:21:47,480
Penalties will be severe.

1293
01:21:49,000 --> 01:21:50,280
Now, as you know,

1294
01:21:50,400 --> 01:21:55,600
the object is to ensure a fair
go for all riders and horses,

1295
01:21:55,760 --> 01:22:00,920
which in turn means a fair go
for punters all over the world.

1296
01:22:02,480 --> 01:22:03,760
You all know the rules

1297
01:22:03,920 --> 01:22:06,640
and we're relying on you to do
the right thing.

1298
01:22:06,800 --> 01:22:11,000
So, good luck to you all.
And safe riding.

1299
01:22:11,160 --> 01:22:13,280
ALL: Thank you, sir.

1300
01:22:19,760 --> 01:22:22,160
- Damien.
- G'day, Pat.

1301
01:22:22,280 --> 01:22:24,520
I've been wanting
to talk with you.

1302
01:22:24,680 --> 01:22:25,760
Yeah.

1303
01:22:25,920 --> 01:22:28,280
It's as simple as this the Cup
is won or lost in the turns.

1304
01:22:28,440 --> 01:22:30,240
No, I mean about
what happened last week.

1305
01:22:30,400 --> 01:22:32,200
We race differently
to you guys in Europe.

1306
01:22:32,360 --> 01:22:34,640
There the tracks are wider.
Things develop more slowly.

1307
01:22:34,840 --> 01:22:36,520
Here, you make your move
in the straight,

1308
01:22:36,720 --> 01:22:38,040
watch your back in the turns.

1309
01:22:38,160 --> 01:22:40,120
- Got it?
- I have, Damien. Thanks.

1310
01:22:40,280 --> 01:22:44,960
Good. Because once things start
to bunch up, the gloves are off.

1311
01:22:45,120 --> 01:22:46,520
There's nothing us Aussie boys
love more

1312
01:22:46,640 --> 01:22:48,080
than a bit of rough and tumble.

1313
01:22:48,240 --> 01:22:50,080
- (Chuckles)
- Good luck.

1314
01:22:50,240 --> 01:22:52,280
SPORTSCASTER: It's as busy
as Bourke Street here,

1315
01:22:52,440 --> 01:22:55,160
and there's a hive of activity
here in the mounting yard...

1316
01:22:55,320 --> 01:22:57,480
colour and, as I said,
a lot of nervous tension.

1317
01:22:57,640 --> 01:22:59,640
There still is, of course,
the big question mark

1318
01:22:59,760 --> 01:23:02,320
how a lot of the international
horses may handle this track

1319
01:23:02,480 --> 01:23:04,280
that we've got here today.

1320
01:23:04,400 --> 01:23:06,280
The toppy, Vinnie Roe,
and what an exciting horse.

1321
01:23:06,440 --> 01:23:07,440
He came across here...

1322
01:23:07,640 --> 01:23:11,400
Thank you, gentlemen!
Mount up, please!

1323
01:23:11,560 --> 01:23:14,440
The stable, that wouldn't be
in the same event as he...

1324
01:23:14,600 --> 01:23:16,960
he has got so much ability
and he's such a better horse.

1325
01:23:17,120 --> 01:23:19,720
But bottom line is he still has
to carry the top weight of 59.

1326
01:23:19,880 --> 01:23:21,680
He's got Patrick Smullen
on board.

1327
01:23:21,840 --> 01:23:23,360
The interesting runner
is Media Puzzle,

1328
01:23:23,560 --> 01:23:25,080
the second
of Dermot Weld's chances.

1329
01:23:25,240 --> 01:23:27,560
Boy, didn't he win that
Geelong Cup with authority?

1330
01:23:27,720 --> 01:23:29,000
He broke the track record.

1331
01:23:29,160 --> 01:23:30,480
With Damien Oliver on board,

1332
01:23:30,600 --> 01:23:33,160
wouldn't we love a win
from Ollie and Media Puzzle?

1333
01:23:35,240 --> 01:23:36,360
SPORTSCASTER: Any minute now

1334
01:23:36,520 --> 01:23:38,200
they'll be making their way
to the start.

1335
01:23:38,360 --> 01:23:39,960
Here, love.
Park yourself on that.

1336
01:23:40,120 --> 01:23:42,000
Will the European invaders
steal the Cup,

1337
01:23:42,160 --> 01:23:43,520
or can the legendary trainers...

1338
01:23:43,640 --> 01:23:45,720
Go on help yourselves.

1339
01:23:45,880 --> 01:23:47,520
SPORTSCASTER:
And imagine the scenes

1340
01:23:47,680 --> 01:23:50,560
should champion jockey
Damien Oliver salute.

1341
01:23:50,720 --> 01:23:53,480
They're heading for the track,
and take... 10.

1342
01:23:53,640 --> 01:23:55,200
RACE CALLER:
Ladies and gentlemen,

1343
01:23:55,400 --> 01:23:56,760
the Victoria Racing Club
presents

1344
01:23:56,880 --> 01:24:01,000
the 142nd running of the
Tooheys New Melbourne Cup.

1345
01:24:01,160 --> 01:24:03,800
The field is being led out
by Vinnie Roe,

1346
01:24:03,960 --> 01:24:07,560
prepared by Dermot Weld,
ridden by Patrick Smullen.

1347
01:24:07,720 --> 01:24:09,840
Comes across
as Europe's champion stayer.

1348
01:24:10,000 --> 01:24:12,920
No.1 is Vinnie Roe.

1349
01:24:13,080 --> 01:24:16,320
Vinnie Roe at $5.50. Who wants
him now? Place your bets here.

1350
01:24:16,440 --> 01:24:18,280
Here you go. $20 to win.
Media Puzzle.

1351
01:24:18,400 --> 01:24:21,040
Vinnie Roe will start favourite
in this year's Melbourne Cup,

1352
01:24:21,160 --> 01:24:23,480
and a firm favourite, too,
at $5.50.

1353
01:24:23,640 --> 01:24:25,720
There's been very good
late support for Pugin.

1354
01:24:25,840 --> 01:24:27,640
He's firmed in
from $10 to $8.50.

1355
01:24:27,800 --> 01:24:31,200
And also Beekeeper,
who has firmed from $10 to $9.

1356
01:24:31,920 --> 01:24:34,040
RACE CALLER: No.9 Pugin.
(Applause)

1357
01:24:34,200 --> 01:24:37,000
Ridden by Frankie Dettori.

1358
01:24:37,160 --> 01:24:38,520
SPORTSCASTER:
In a blaze of sunshine,

1359
01:24:38,680 --> 01:24:39,960
the horses take to the track.

1360
01:24:40,120 --> 01:24:43,000
Could this be Godolphin's year?
There are many who think so.

1361
01:24:45,360 --> 01:24:49,360
No.14 Media Puzzle!
Damien Oliver!

1362
01:24:49,520 --> 01:24:51,440
(Cheering and applause)

1363
01:25:00,160 --> 01:25:01,520
You show 'em, mate.

1364
01:25:03,200 --> 01:25:05,680
Show 'em what we're made of.

1365
01:25:07,040 --> 01:25:10,040
Fifteen Mr Prudent.
Corey Brown.

1366
01:25:10,680 --> 01:25:12,480
BOTH: Oops.
DERMOT: Sorry.

1367
01:25:12,600 --> 01:25:14,440
- I demand a stewards' inquiry.
- (Chuckles)

1368
01:25:14,600 --> 01:25:16,560
When my horses win,
it will be done in a manner

1369
01:25:16,720 --> 01:25:18,400
completely free of controversy.

1370
01:25:18,560 --> 01:25:20,840
- Good luck, Saeed.
- Good luck to you, Dermot Weld.

1371
01:25:21,000 --> 01:25:23,240
But this time I think
you need it more than Godolphin.

1372
01:25:30,400 --> 01:25:33,120
- Has it started?
- No, no. Not yet.

1373
01:25:33,240 --> 01:25:35,400
- You haven't missed a thing.
- Hello.

1374
01:25:35,600 --> 01:25:38,520
(Gasps) Is that Veronica?

1375
01:25:38,680 --> 01:25:42,000
Oh, yeah, it is.
She'd have loved this.

1376
01:25:42,960 --> 01:25:45,040
SPORTSCASTER: Have the local
battlers got enough in the tank

1377
01:25:45,200 --> 01:25:46,960
to foil
the international raiders?

1378
01:25:47,120 --> 01:25:49,480
Miss Melise could be
the dark horse of the field

1379
01:25:49,680 --> 01:25:51,440
and she's trained
by Cups king Bart...

1380
01:25:51,640 --> 01:25:53,160
Bit more right. Bit more.

1381
01:25:53,320 --> 01:25:55,600
Getting there. Yeah,
that's good. It's good.

1382
01:25:55,760 --> 01:25:58,240
OK, fellas, lucky dip. Go.

1383
01:25:58,400 --> 01:26:01,080
MAN: I got Media Puzzle!
MAN 2: What have you got, mate?

1384
01:26:01,240 --> 01:26:03,240
(Men chat and chuckle)

1385
01:26:03,400 --> 01:26:05,440
COMMENTATOR: ..but he says
it's anybody's race.

1386
01:26:05,600 --> 01:26:08,520
Other experts say it's
between Dermot Weld's entries

1387
01:26:08,680 --> 01:26:10,880
and the highly credentialed
Godolphins.

1388
01:26:11,040 --> 01:26:13,040
Both have performed well
in lead-up events

1389
01:26:13,200 --> 01:26:14,920
and they look in great shape.

1390
01:26:15,080 --> 01:26:16,880
(Sheep bleat)

1391
01:26:17,040 --> 01:26:18,360
Sevens or eights on Pugin.

1392
01:26:18,520 --> 01:26:20,200
Eights that's value.
Eights on Pugin.

1393
01:26:20,360 --> 01:26:22,760
And seven on Media Puzzle.
Come on, who wants Damien?

1394
01:26:22,880 --> 01:26:24,680
- Sounds good.
- Ten, Vinnie. Give me 20.

1395
01:26:24,840 --> 01:26:27,480
Twenty on Vinnie Roe. No
worries. What else have you got?

1396
01:26:27,640 --> 01:26:30,000
- Twenty on Damien.
- Twenty on Damien. Very good.

1397
01:26:30,160 --> 01:26:32,080
(Speaks French)

1398
01:26:41,840 --> 01:26:43,640
OK, riders, time to go.

1399
01:26:43,800 --> 01:26:45,600
RACE CALLER:
Starter's calling them up now

1400
01:26:45,760 --> 01:26:47,560
for the Tooheys
New Melbourne Cup.

1401
01:26:47,760 --> 01:26:49,560
The field is getting set.

1402
01:26:49,720 --> 01:26:51,440
It's English raider
Jardines Lookout

1403
01:26:51,600 --> 01:26:53,000
coming to a gate
near the outside.

1404
01:26:53,160 --> 01:26:55,520
The Saab winner, Requiem,
comes in.

1405
01:26:55,640 --> 01:26:58,000
Rain Gauge and Mr Prudent
just in.

1406
01:26:58,160 --> 01:27:00,800
Just another day at the beach,
mate. You'll be just fine.

1407
01:27:00,960 --> 01:27:03,280
Damien Oliver brings
Media Puzzle in.

1408
01:27:03,440 --> 01:27:05,120
And Vinnie Roe,

1409
01:27:05,280 --> 01:27:08,160
the horse who's been backed into
favouritism on track, comes up.

1410
01:27:08,360 --> 01:27:09,760
Easy, there. That's right.

1411
01:27:09,920 --> 01:27:12,320
Patrick Smullen and Dermot Weld.

1412
01:27:14,000 --> 01:27:16,800
- Now here's Sandmason coming...
- Righto, Cathy. Close race 7.

1413
01:27:16,960 --> 01:27:18,800
The field is nearly ready.

1414
01:27:19,440 --> 01:27:22,960
Pugin is coming into a place
next to Rain Gauge.

1415
01:27:24,040 --> 01:27:25,840
And they're just about ready.

1416
01:27:26,000 --> 01:27:27,960
(Horse shrieks)

1417
01:27:29,840 --> 01:27:31,280
RACE CALLER: Trying
to get over the front

1418
01:27:31,440 --> 01:27:32,760
of the barrier stalls there,

1419
01:27:32,920 --> 01:27:34,720
Helene Vitality.

1420
01:27:34,840 --> 01:27:37,720
It's alright, mate. He's just
trying to get the jump on us.

1421
01:27:37,880 --> 01:27:40,640
RACE CALLER: Helene Vitality
settles. Starter to the ladder.

1422
01:27:44,240 --> 01:27:46,160
And they're about to go.

1423
01:27:59,480 --> 01:28:02,640
Alright, buddy.
This one's for Jase.

1424
01:28:11,480 --> 01:28:14,680
Racing. Helene Vitality
a little slow.

1425
01:28:14,840 --> 01:28:17,600
Distinctly Secret got out
quickly. So did Prized Gem.

1426
01:28:17,760 --> 01:28:19,560
Thong Classic near the outside.

1427
01:28:19,720 --> 01:28:22,080
Victory Smile and Daliapour
into stride fast.

1428
01:28:22,280 --> 01:28:23,400
Vinnie Roe's getting across

1429
01:28:23,520 --> 01:28:24,960
to be just behind
the leading bunch,

1430
01:28:25,160 --> 01:28:26,720
Media Puzzle ahead of him.

1431
01:28:26,880 --> 01:28:29,840
Settling down now.
Racing up on the 2.800 m mark.

1432
01:28:30,000 --> 01:28:32,880
Daliapour on the inside and
Victory Smile are the leaders.

1433
01:28:33,040 --> 01:28:36,680
Wider out, Sandmason going on.
Requiem just inside him.

1434
01:28:36,840 --> 01:28:39,720
And then followed by Hatha Anna
on the improve on the outside.

1435
01:28:39,880 --> 01:28:42,160
Damien has Media Puzzle
behind the speed,

1436
01:28:42,280 --> 01:28:44,080
closely followed by Cyclades.

1437
01:28:44,200 --> 01:28:47,360
Pugin's going up wide, too,
around County Tyrone,

1438
01:28:47,520 --> 01:28:49,440
and then followed by Vinnie Roe.

1439
01:28:49,600 --> 01:28:52,080
Helene Vitality from the
outside, and then Pentastic,

1440
01:28:52,280 --> 01:28:53,880
Distinctly Secret, Mr Prudent...

1441
01:28:54,040 --> 01:28:55,480
(Hoofs thundering)

1442
01:28:55,640 --> 01:28:58,880
Media Puzzle's in good shape.

1443
01:28:59,040 --> 01:29:01,880
So is Vinnie. And everyone else.

1444
01:29:02,000 --> 01:29:04,600
Then Rain Gauge and Freemason
three lengths away.

1445
01:29:04,720 --> 01:29:06,920
Out of the straight.
Sandmason may claim the Cup.

1446
01:29:07,080 --> 01:29:09,240
A length and a half clear.
Hatha Anna second.

1447
01:29:09,360 --> 01:29:12,600
Pugin next, travelling three
deep. Damien has Media Puzzle...

1448
01:29:12,760 --> 01:29:14,680
(Hoofs thundering)

1449
01:29:17,160 --> 01:29:19,320
DERMOT: It's almost time.
- Time for what?

1450
01:29:19,480 --> 01:29:21,360
For Godolphins
to show their hand.

1451
01:29:21,520 --> 01:29:23,320
RACE CALLER:
And Godolphins on the move.

1452
01:29:23,440 --> 01:29:26,520
Sandmason led narrowly.
Hatha Anna's up to second now.

1453
01:29:26,680 --> 01:29:28,600
Dettori has Pugin
just behind them.

1454
01:29:28,720 --> 01:29:30,640
Vinnie Roe is making a move.

1455
01:29:30,800 --> 01:29:31,880
Media Puzzle next,

1456
01:29:32,040 --> 01:29:34,320
with Victory Smile
on his inside, about midfield.

1457
01:29:34,480 --> 01:29:36,880
Then followed by Pentastic,
Thong Classic.

1458
01:29:37,040 --> 01:29:39,600
Jardines Lookout is well back
and so is Hail.

1459
01:29:39,760 --> 01:29:42,080
(Thundering hoofs)

1460
01:29:42,200 --> 01:29:44,920
Beekeeper's covering some ground
and so too Mr Prudent,

1461
01:29:45,080 --> 01:29:47,960
but Damien Oliver's giving
Media Puzzle a charmed run

1462
01:29:48,120 --> 01:29:50,440
in behind the pace,
which was set by Sandmason.

1463
01:29:50,560 --> 01:29:53,520
Come on, big fella. Come on!

1464
01:29:53,680 --> 01:29:55,480
(Thundering hoofs)

1465
01:29:56,920 --> 01:29:59,160
a fast-run Melbourne Cup.
Pugin is third.

1466
01:29:59,320 --> 01:30:01,760
Will one of them go after him?

1467
01:30:01,920 --> 01:30:03,360
Not Damien or our Pat.

1468
01:30:03,520 --> 01:30:06,120
Those two know better than
to go chasing rabbits.

1469
01:30:06,320 --> 01:30:07,720
They've been warned.

1470
01:30:07,880 --> 01:30:10,560
Followed by Pentastic.
Distinctly Secret, Mr Prudent,

1471
01:30:10,720 --> 01:30:11,760
County Tyrone,

1472
01:30:11,920 --> 01:30:14,600
then followed by Media Puzzle
outside Victory Smile,

1473
01:30:14,840 --> 01:30:16,160
and then Thong Classic.

1474
01:30:16,320 --> 01:30:18,160
Hatha Anna has dashed
to the front now

1475
01:30:18,320 --> 01:30:19,360
for Godolphin by three.

1476
01:30:19,520 --> 01:30:22,440
In second placing Sandmason,
then Pugin.

1477
01:30:22,600 --> 01:30:25,040
Then Beekeeper.
He's followed by Pentastic.

1478
01:30:25,160 --> 01:30:27,200
Vinnie Roe's gone up to fourth,
followed by Daliapour,

1479
01:30:27,360 --> 01:30:28,960
as they come to the home turn.

1480
01:30:29,120 --> 01:30:30,640
Let's see what he's got, Pat.

1481
01:30:30,800 --> 01:30:32,880
Media Puzzle's working into it
for Ollie.

1482
01:30:33,040 --> 01:30:35,920
- Yes! Yes!
- ..And Beekeeper's coming.

1483
01:30:36,080 --> 01:30:38,640
They're followed by Mr Prudent
as they twist the corner.

1484
01:30:38,800 --> 01:30:40,440
Now, boys, now!

1485
01:30:40,600 --> 01:30:43,080
And now Media Puzzle.
Damien's winding him up.

1486
01:30:43,240 --> 01:30:45,000
Media Puzzle and Vinnie Roe
neck and neck.

1487
01:30:45,160 --> 01:30:46,960
Come on there, boys!
You're both in it!

1488
01:30:47,120 --> 01:30:48,880
The two great Irish gallopers
are coming.

1489
01:30:49,040 --> 01:30:50,800
But so too wide out now
Beekeeper and Mr Prudent.

1490
01:30:50,960 --> 01:30:52,680
One of them's going to do it!

1491
01:30:52,840 --> 01:30:55,560
Still there's nothing
between them! What a finish!

1492
01:30:55,720 --> 01:30:57,000
Passing the 350.

1493
01:30:57,120 --> 01:30:59,400
Damien Oliver sends Media Puzzle
to the lead,

1494
01:30:59,560 --> 01:31:01,360
ahead of Vinnie Roe,
who can't find.

1495
01:31:01,560 --> 01:31:03,840
Back behind them -
Beekeeper and Mr Prudent.

1496
01:31:04,000 --> 01:31:05,240
But Damien Oliver,

1497
01:31:05,400 --> 01:31:06,800
riding with
the spirit of Jason...

1498
01:31:06,960 --> 01:31:08,440
BOTH: Oh! Oh! Oh!

1499
01:31:08,600 --> 01:31:10,760
I think he's got the Cup won.

1500
01:31:10,920 --> 01:31:13,840
(Loud cheering)
- Yes! Come on!

1501
01:31:13,960 --> 01:31:15,760
BOTH: Yes! Yes! Yes!

1502
01:31:15,920 --> 01:31:20,000
But it's Media Puzzle clear,
and Media Puzzle!

1503
01:31:20,160 --> 01:31:21,960
Damien and Dermot have done it.

1504
01:31:22,160 --> 01:31:25,040
(Crowd roars)
- Oh! Magnificent, Dermot!

1505
01:31:27,080 --> 01:31:29,240
Yeah! Good boy!

1506
01:31:31,240 --> 01:31:34,760
My boy! Yes!

1507
01:31:34,920 --> 01:31:36,840
(Cheering)

1508
01:31:38,520 --> 01:31:41,120
RACE CALLER: And then
Victory Smile. Helene Vitality.

1509
01:31:41,280 --> 01:31:43,800
Pugin and Hatha Anna
at the tail, with Sandmason.

1510
01:31:43,960 --> 01:31:45,840
And Requiem is one of the last.

1511
01:31:46,000 --> 01:31:47,640
It will be the most

1512
01:31:47,800 --> 01:31:50,560
emotion-charged Melbourne Cup
reception in history.

1513
01:31:50,720 --> 01:31:54,080
(Applause)
- Damien Oliver has done it.

1514
01:31:54,200 --> 01:31:56,880
The riders in the stand were
with him every step of the way.

1515
01:31:57,040 --> 01:31:59,360
ALL: Yes!

1516
01:31:59,520 --> 01:32:03,000
Sometimes I think
you're the devil himself!

1517
01:32:03,160 --> 01:32:05,680
Good on you, mate.

1518
01:32:05,840 --> 01:32:09,440
Good on you. Eh?

1519
01:32:09,600 --> 01:32:10,400
(Applause)

1520
01:32:10,560 --> 01:32:12,840
For Damien! For us!
For everyone!

1521
01:32:13,000 --> 01:32:15,200
Yeah, I know, I know.
Media Puzzle!

1522
01:32:15,360 --> 01:32:16,960
Who would have thought it?

1523
01:32:21,160 --> 01:32:22,880
I thought the turns
were supposed to be

1524
01:32:23,040 --> 01:32:24,360
the key to winning this race.

1525
01:32:24,520 --> 01:32:26,320
Australia's top jockey
once told me so.

1526
01:32:26,480 --> 01:32:28,720
But today, I lost it
on the straight.

1527
01:32:29,640 --> 01:32:31,800
- Way to bring him home, matey.
- Thanks, Pat.

1528
01:32:33,680 --> 01:32:36,080
- Magnifico, Damien.
- Hey.

1529
01:32:36,200 --> 01:32:37,760
No-one could beat
you today, huh?

1530
01:32:37,920 --> 01:32:40,400
The saints, I think,
they would not allow it.

1531
01:32:40,560 --> 01:32:42,360
Thanks, Frankie.

1532
01:32:42,520 --> 01:32:44,120
Ollie.

1533
01:32:44,280 --> 01:32:47,160
Hey. Another 20 yards,
you would have had me.

1534
01:32:47,360 --> 01:32:50,400
- Not with him riding with you.
- Good on you, mate. Cheers.

1535
01:32:50,560 --> 01:32:53,000
Ladies and gentlemen,
I don't think there's ever been

1536
01:32:53,120 --> 01:32:55,120
a more popular Melbourne Cup
winner...

1537
01:32:55,280 --> 01:32:59,120
No.14, Media Puzzle,
ridden by Damien Oliver.

1538
01:32:59,280 --> 01:33:02,160
I Majestic music

1539
01:33:05,360 --> 01:33:06,920
RACE CALLER:
Everyone at Flemington

1540
01:33:07,080 --> 01:33:09,120
was riding with you, Damien.

1541
01:33:09,280 --> 01:33:11,200
A supercharged ride.

1542
01:33:18,960 --> 01:33:20,880
And the Irish wizard,
Dermot Weld,

1543
01:33:21,000 --> 01:33:23,160
has rewritten the record books
yet again.

1544
01:33:23,320 --> 01:33:24,560
Bloody rogue.

1545
01:33:37,400 --> 01:33:41,160
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome
back to the winners enclosure.

1546
01:33:41,320 --> 01:33:43,360
A more popular
Melbourne Cup winner,

1547
01:33:43,480 --> 01:33:45,480
I don't think we've ever seen.

1548
01:33:45,640 --> 01:33:49,640
Media Puzzle, Damien Oliver
and Dermot Weld.

1549
01:33:58,560 --> 01:34:00,840
DAMIEN: Thanks.
- (Laughs)

1550
01:34:12,960 --> 01:34:15,240

Ladies and gentlemen,

1555
01:34:52,480 --> 01:34:55,920
it's my greatest pleasure
at these awards to say

1556
01:34:56,080 --> 01:34:59,040
that this was a very special day for me

1557
01:34:59,200 --> 01:35:00,760
when I saw my two brave horses

1558
01:35:00,920 --> 01:35:02,280
turn for home

1559
01:35:02,440 --> 01:35:04,400
upsides of the Melbourne Cup.

1560
01:35:04,560 --> 01:35:06,720
That's what you dream about.

1561
01:35:06,880 --> 01:35:09,120
And I was so proud of Media Puzzle.

1562
01:35:09,280 --> 01:35:11,280

Vinnie Roe ran a superb race,

1565
01:35:15,640 --> 01:35:18,200
but it was Media Puzzle's day today.

1566
01:35:18,360 --> 01:35:20,280
(Applause)

1567
01:35:22,320 --> 01:35:23,880
To all the people out there in the crowd,

1568
01:35:24,040 --> 01:35:25,400
you've been a wonderful support

1569
01:35:25,560 --> 01:35:26,840
through the last two days,

1570
01:35:27,000 --> 01:35:28,320
through this trying time.

1571
01:35:28,480 --> 01:35:29,800
And my brother, Jason,

1572
01:35:29,960 --> 01:35:31,760
I know you're up there, mate.

1573
01:35:39,120 --> 01:35:40,600
And I couldn't have done it

1574
01:35:40,760 --> 01:35:41,800
without you, buddy,

1575
01:35:41,960 --> 01:35:43,600
so this one's for you.
